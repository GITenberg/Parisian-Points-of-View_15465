<h2>THE SHORT STORIES OF M. LUDOVIC HAL&Eacute;VY</h2>


<p>To most American readers of fiction I fancy
that M. Ludovic Hal&eacute;vy is known chiefly, if not
solely, as the author of that most charming of modern
French novels, <i>The Abb&eacute; Constantin</i>. Some of
these readers may have disliked this or that novel
of M. Zola's because of its bad moral, and this or
that novel of M. Ohnet's because of its bad taste,
and all of them were delighted to discover in M.
Hal&eacute;vy's interesting and artistic work a story written
by a French gentleman for young ladies. Here
and there a scoffer might sneer at the tale of the
old French priest and the young women from Canada
as innocuous and saccharine; but the story of
the good Abb&eacute; Constantin and of his nephew, and
of the girl the nephew loved in spite of her American
millions&mdash;this story had the rare good fortune
of pleasing at once the broad public of indiscriminate
readers of fiction and the narrower circle of
real lovers of literature. Artificial the atmosphere
of the tale might be, but it was with an artifice at
once delicate and delicious; and the tale itself won
its way into the hearts of the women of America
as it had into the hearts of the women of France.</p>

<p>There is even a legend&mdash;although how solid a
foundation it may have in fact I do not dare to discuss&mdash;there
is a legend that the lady-superior of a
certain convent near Paris was so fascinated by
<i>The Abb&eacute; Constantin</i>, and so thoroughly convinced
of the piety of its author, that she ordered all his
other works, receiving in due season the lively volumes
wherein are recorded the sayings and doings
of Monsieur and Madame Cardinal, and of the two
lovely daughters of Monsieur and Madame Cardinal.
To note that these very amusing studies of
certain aspects of life in a modern capital originally
appeared in that extraordinary journal, <i>La Vie
Parisienne</i>&mdash;now sadly degenerate&mdash;is enough to indicate
that they are not precisely what the good
lady-superior expected to receive. We may not
say that <i>La Famille Cardinal</i> is one of the books
every gentleman's library should be without; but
to appreciate its value requires a far different knowledge
of the world and of its wickedness than is
needed to understand <i>The Abb&eacute; Constantin</i>.</p>

<p>Yet the picture of the good priest and the portraits
of the little Cardinals are the work of the
same hand, plainly enough. In both of these
books, as in <i>Criquette</i> (M. Hal&eacute;vy's only other
novel), as in <i>A Marriage for Love</i>, and the twoscore
other short stories he has written during the
past thirty years, there are the same artistic qualities,
the same sharpness of vision, the same gentle
irony, the same constructive skill, and the same
dramatic touch. It is to be remembered always
that the author of <i>L'Abb&eacute; Constantin</i> is also the
half-author of &quot;Froufrou&quot; and of &quot;Tricoche et
Cacolet,&quot; as well as of the librettos of &quot;La Belle
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne&quot; and of &quot;La Grande Duchesse de Gerolstein.&quot;</p>

<p>In the two novels, as in the twoscore short stories
and sketches&mdash;the <i>contes</i> and the <i>nouvelles</i> which
are now spring-like idyls and now wintry episodes,
now sombre etchings and now gayly-colored pastels&mdash;in
all the works of the story-teller we see the
firm grasp of the dramatist. The characters speak
for themselves; each reveals himself with the swift
directness of the personages of a play. They are
not talked about and about, for all analysis has
been done by the playwright before he rings up the
curtain in the first paragraph. And the story unrolls
itself, also, as rapidly as does a comedy. The
movement is straightforward. There is the cleverness
and the ingenuity of the accomplished dramatist,
but the construction has the simplicity of the
highest skill. The arrangement of incidents is so
artistic that it seems inevitable; and no one is ever
moved to wonder whether or not the tale might
have been better told in different fashion.</p>

<p>Nephew of the composer of &quot;La Juive&quot;&mdash;an
opera not now heard as often as it deserves, perhaps&mdash;and
son of a playwright no one of whose
productions now survives, M. Hal&eacute;vy grew up in
the theatre. At fourteen he was on the free-list of
the Op&eacute;ra, the Op&eacute;ra-Comique, and the Od&eacute;on.
After he left school and went into the civil service
his one wish was to write plays, and so to be able
to afford to resign his post. In the civil service
he had an inside view of French politics, which
gave him a distaste for the mere game of government
without in any way impairing the vigor of his
patriotism; as is proved by certain of the short
stones dealing with the war of 1870 and the revolt
of the Paris Communists. And while he did his
work faithfully, he had spare hours to give to literature.
He wrote plays and stories, and they were
rejected. The manager of the Od&eacute;on declared that
one early play of M. Hal&eacute;vy's was exactly suited
to the Gymnase, and the manager of the Gymnase
protested that it was exactly suited to the Od&eacute;on.
The editor of a daily journal said that one early
tale of M. Hal&eacute;vy's was too brief for a novel, and
the editor of a weekly paper said that it was too
long for a short story.</p>

<p>In time, of course, his luck turned; he had plays
performed and stories published; and at last he
met M. Henri Meilhac, and entered on that collaboration
of nearly twenty years' duration to which
we owe &quot;Froufrou&quot; and &quot;Tricoche et Cacolet,&quot; on
the one hand, and on the other the books of Offenbach's
most brilliant operas&mdash;&quot;Barbebleue,&quot; for example,
and &quot;La P&eacute;richole.&quot; When this collaboration
terminated, shortly before M. Hal&eacute;vy wrote
<i>The Abb&eacute; Constantin</i>, he gave up writing for the
stage. The training of the playwright he could
not give up, if he would, nor the intimacy with the
manners and customs of the people who live, move,
and have their being on the far side of the curtain.</p>

<p>Obviously M. Hal&eacute;vy is fond of the actors and
the actresses with whom he spent the years of his
manhood. They appear again and again in his
tales; and in his treatment of them there is never
anything ungentlemanly as there was in M. Jean
Richepin's recent volume of theatrical sketches.
M. Hal&eacute;vy's liking for the men and women of the
stage is deep; and wide is his knowledge of their
changing moods. The young Criquette and the
old Karikari and the aged Dancing-master&mdash;he
knows them all thoroughly, and he likes them
heartily, and he sympathizes with them cordially.
Indeed, nowhere can one find more kindly portraits
of the kindly player-folk than in the writings
of this half-author of &quot;Froufrou&quot;; it is as though
the successful dramatist felt ever grateful towards
the partners of his toil, the companions of his
struggles. He is not blind to their manifold weaknesses,
nor is he the dupe of their easy emotionalism,
but he is tolerant of their failings, and towards
them, at least, his irony is never mordant.</p>

<p>Irony is one of M. Hal&eacute;vy's chief characteristics,
perhaps the chiefest. It is gentle when he deals
with the people of the stage&mdash;far gentler then than
when he is dealing with the people of Society, with
fashionable folk, with the aristocracy of wealth.
When he is telling us of the young loves of millionaires
and of million-heiresses, his touch may seem
caressing, but for all its softness the velvet paw has
claws none the less. It is amusing to note how
often M. Hal&eacute;vy has chosen to tell the tale of love
among the very rich. The heroine of <i>The Abb&eacute;
Constantin</i> is immensely wealthy, as we all know,
and immensely wealthy are the heroines of <i>Princesse</i>,
of <i>A Grand Marriage,</i> and of <i>In the Express</i>.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
Sometimes the heroes and the heroines
are not only immensely wealthy, they are also of
the loftiest birth; such, for instance, are the young
couple whose acquaintance we make in the pages
of <i>Only a Waltz</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Perhaps the present writer will be forgiven if he wishes
to record here that <i>In the Express (Par le Rapide)</i> was
published in Paris only towards the end of 1892, while a tale
not wholly unlike it, <i>In the Vestibule Limited</i>, was published
in New York in the spring of 1891.</p></div>

<p>There is no trace or taint of snobbery in M.
Hal&eacute;vy's treatment of all this magnificence; there
is none of the vulgarity which marks the pages of
<i>Lothair</i>, for example; there is no mean admiration
of mean things. There is, on the other hand,
no bitterness of scourging satire. He lets us see
that all this luxury is a little cloying and perhaps
not a little enervating. He suggests (although he
takes care never to say it) that perhaps wealth
and birth are not really the best the world can
offer. The amiable egotism of the hero of <i>In the
Express</i>, and the not unkindly selfishness of the
heroine of that most Parisian love-story, are set before
us without insistence, it is true, but with an
irony so keen that even he who runs as he reads
may not mistake the author's real opinion of the
characters he has evoked.</p>

<p>To say this is to say that M. Hal&eacute;vy's irony is
delicate and playful. There is no harshness in his
manner and no hatred in his mind. We do not
find in his pages any of the pessimism which is
perhaps the dominant characteristic of the best
French fiction of our time. To M. Hal&eacute;vy, as to
every thinking man, life is serious, no doubt, but
it need not be taken sadly, or even solemnly. To
him life seems still enjoyable, as it must to most
of those who have a vivid sense of humor. He is
not disillusioned utterly, he is not reduced to the
blankness of despair as are so many of the disciples
of Flaubert, who are cast into the outer darkness,
and who hopelessly revolt against the doom
they have brought on themselves.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is Merim&eacute;e that M. Hal&eacute;vy would hail
as his master, and not Flaubert, whom most of
his fellow French writers of fiction follow blindly.
Now, while the author of <i>Salamnbo</i> was a romanticist
turned sour, the author of <i>Carmen</i> was
a sentimentalist sheathed in irony. To Gustave
Flaubert the world was hideously ugly, and he
wished it strangely and splendidly beautiful, and
he detested it the more because of his impossible
ideal. To Prosper Merim&eacute;e the world was what
it is, to be taken and made the best of, every
man keeping himself carefully guarded. Like Merim&eacute;e,
M. Hal&eacute;vy is detached, but he is not disenchanted.
His work is more joyous than Merim&eacute;e's,
if not so vigorous and compact, and his delight
in it is less disguised. Even in the Cardinal
sketches there is nothing that leaves an acrid
after-taste, nothing corroding&mdash;as there is not seldom
in the stronger and sterner short stories of
Maupassant.</p>

<p>More than Maupassant or Flaubert or Merim&eacute;e,
is M. Hal&eacute;vy a Parisian. Whether or not the characters
of his tale are dwellers in the capital, whether
or not the scene of his story is laid in the city
by the Seine, the point of view is always Parisian.
The <i>Circus Charger</i> did his duty in the stately
avenues of a noble country-place, and <i>Blacky</i> performed
his task near a rustic water-fall; but the
men who record their intelligent actions are Parisians
of the strictest sect. Even in the patriotic
pieces called forth by the war of 1870, in the <i>Insurgent</i>
and in the <i>Chinese Ambassador</i>, it is the
siege of Paris and the struggle of the Communists
which seem to the author most important. His
style even, his swift and limpid prose&mdash;the prose
which somehow corresponds to the best <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>
in its brilliancy and buoyancy&mdash;is the style of
one who lives at the centre of things. Cardinal
Newman once said that while Livy and Tacitus
and Terence and Seneca wrote Latin, Cicero wrote
Roman; so while M. Zola on the one side, and M.
Georges Ohnet on the other, may write French, M.
Hal&eacute;vy writes Parisian.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt, dear aunt, don't believe a word of what
he is going to tell you. He is preparing to fib, to
fib outrageously. If I hadn't interrupted him at
the beginning of his talk, he would have told you
that he had made up his mind to marry me from
his and my earliest childhood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course!&quot; exclaimed Gontran.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course not,&quot; replied Marceline. &quot;He was
going to tell you that he was a good little boy,
having always loved his little cousin, and that our
marriage was a delightful romance of tenderness
and sweetness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, yes, of course,&quot; repeated Gontran.</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense! The truth, Aunt Louise, the real
truth, in short, is this, never, never should we have
been married if on the 17th of May, 1890, between
nine and eleven o'clock, he had not lost 34,000
points at bezique at the club, and if all the boxes
had not been sold, that same night, at the Bouffes-Parisiens
Theatre.&quot;</p>

<p>Gontran began to laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you can laugh as much as you please!
You know very well that but for this&mdash;on what
does fate depend?&mdash;I should now be married and
a duchess, it is true; but Duchess of Courtalin, and
not Duchess of Lannilis. Well, perhaps that would
have been better! At any rate, I wish to give
Aunt Louise the authentic history of our marriage.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell away, if it amuses you,&quot; said Gontran.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir, it amuses me. You shall know all,
Aunt Louise&mdash;all, absolutely all; and I beg you to
be judge of our quarrel.&quot;</p>

<p>This scene was taking place eight days after
Marceline de Lorlauge, at the Church of the Madeleine,
before the altar, hidden under a mountain of
roses, had answered &quot;yes,&quot; with just the right
amount of nervousness and emotion (neither too
much nor too little, but exactly right), when she was
asked if she was willing to take for husband her
cousin, Jean Leopold Mathurin Arbert Gontran,
Duke of Lannilis.</p>

<p>This marriage had been the great marriage of the
season. There had been an absolute crush under
the colonnade and against the railings of the church
to see the bride walk down those fearful steps of
the Madeleine. What an important feat that is!
Merely to be beautiful is not all that is needful; it
is necessary besides to know how to be beautiful.
There is an art about being pretty which requires
certain preparations and study. In society, as in
the theatre, success rarely comes at once. Mme.
de Lannilis had the good-fortune to make her
first appearance with decisive success. She was at
once quite easily and boldly at home in her beauty;
she had only to appear to triumph. Prince
N&eacute;rins had not a moment's hesitation concerning
it, and he it is, as every one knows, who, with
general consent, has made himself the distributor
of the patents of supreme Parisian elegance;
so while the new duchess, beneath the fire of a
thousand eyes and behind the ringing staffs, was
taking her first steps as a young married woman
with calm assurance, N&eacute;rins, struck with admiration,
was giving way, under the colonnade of the
Madeleine, to veritable transports of enthusiasm.
He went from group to group repeating:</p>

<p>&quot;She is aerial! There is no other expression
for her&mdash;aerial! She does not walk, she glides!
If she had the fantasy, with one little kick of her
heel, she could raise herself lightly over the heads
of those two tall fellows with spears, cross the
Place de la Concorde, and go and place herself on
the pediment of the Chamber of Deputies. Look
at her well; that is true beauty, radiant beauty,
blazing beauty! She is a goddess, a young goddess!
she will reign long, gentlemen&mdash;as long as
possible.&quot;</p>

<p>The young goddess, for the present, did not go
farther than Lannilis, in Poitou, to her husband's
home&mdash;her home&mdash;in a mansion that had seen
many Duchesses of Lannilis, but never one more
charming, and never, it must be said, one more absolutely
in love. This little duchess of nineteen
was wild about this little duke of twenty-five, who
was jealously carrying her off for himself alone to
a quiet and solitary retreat.</p>

<p>They had arrived Thursday, the 24th of June, at
about two o'clock&mdash;on an exquisite night beneath
a star-spangled sky&mdash;and they were suddenly
astounded at receiving a letter from their Aunt
Louise, dated July 1:</p>

<p>&quot;Eight days' steady t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,&quot; she wrote, &quot;is
enough, quite enough. Trust to the experience of
an old countrywoman, who would be delighted to
kiss her little nephew and niece. Don't eat all
your love in the bud&mdash;keep a little for the future.&quot;</p>

<p>Thursday, the 1st of July! Eight days! They
had been eight days at Lannilis! It was impossible!
They tried to put some order in their reflections.
What had they done Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday? But all was vague, and became confused
in their minds. The days and the nights,
and the nights and days. What had they done?
It was always the same, same thing; and the same
thing had somehow never been the same thing.</p>

<p>They had just loved, loved, loved; and, quite given
up to this very wise occupation, they had completely
forgotten that near Lannilis, in the old residence
of Chatellerault, there was dear old Aunt
Louise, who was expecting their first bridal visit&mdash;a
visit which was due her, for she had the best claim
in the world, on account of her eighty-four years,
her kindness, and also because of the gift of a
magnificent pearl necklace to Marceline.</p>

<p>So it was necessary to be resigned, to leave off
dreaming, and to come back to reality; and it was
during this visit that, before the old aunt, much
amused at the quarrel, this great dispute had
abruptly burst forth between the young married
couple.</p>

<p>Aunt Louise had accepted the position of arbitrator,
and, presiding over the discussion, she had
made the two contestants sit down before her in
arm-chairs, at a respectful distance. Marceline,
before being seated, had already taken the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Every one agreed upon this point (you know
it, Aunt Louise; mamma must often have told you
in her letters)&mdash;every one was agreed on this point:
that there were really only two suitable matches
for me&mdash;the Duke of Lannilis here present, and the
Duke of Courtalin. I had the weakness to prefer
him&mdash;him over there. Why? I can scarcely tell-a
childish habit, doubtless. We had played together
when we were no higher than that at being
little husband and wife. I had remained faithful to
that childhood love, whereas he&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whereas I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All in due season, sir, and you will lose nothing
by waiting. However, there were all sorts of good
reasons for preferring&mdash;the other one, who had a
larger fortune and was of more ancient nobility.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, as to that&mdash;in money, maybe, but as to
birth&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is indisputable! You are both dukes by
patent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We in 1663.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the Courtalin&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In 1666 only.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Agreed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, just wait! I am posted on the question;
mamma studied it thoroughly when things looked,
three months ago, as if I should be Duchess of
Courtalin. One morning mamma went to the archives
with an old friend of hers, a great historian,
who is a member of the Institute. You date from
1663, and the Courtalin from 1666; that is correct.
But Louis XIV., in 1672, by a special edict, gave the
precedence to the Courtalins; and you have not,
I suppose, any idea of disputing what Louis XIV.
thought best to do. Now, Aunt Louise, can he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Saint Simon&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, let us leave Saint Simon alone; he is prejudice
and inaccuracy itself! I know he is on your
side, but that doesn't count; but I will, to be agreeable
to you, acknowledge that you are better looking
and taller than M. de Courtalin&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my dear, I begin to see! You are dying
for me to tell you that. Well, yes, you are a fairly
handsome man; but that is only a very perishable
advantage, and you have too much respect for conventionalities
to wish to make that equal to the decree
of Louis XIV. However, I loved you&mdash;I loved
you faithfully, tenderly, fondly, stupidly; yes, stupidly,
for when I had come out in society, the year
before, in April, 1889, at Mme. de Fresnes's ball,
when I had allowed my poor, little, thin shoulders
to be seen for the first time (I must have been about
seventeen), I noticed that the young marriageable
men in our set (they are all quoted, noted, and labelled)
drew away from me with strange, respectful
deference. I appeared to be of no importance or
interest, in spite of my name, my dowry, and my
eyes. You see, I had singed myself. I had so ridiculously
advertised my passion for you that I no
longer belonged to myself; I was considered as
belonging to you. As soon as I had put on my
first long dress, which gave me at once the right to
think of marriage and speak of love, I had told all
my friends that I loved, and would never love or
marry any one but you&mdash;you or the convent. Yes,
I had come to that! My friends had told their
brothers and cousins, who had repeated it to you
(just what I wanted), but it put me out of the race.
Dare to say, sir, that it is not all true, strictly true!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am saying nothing&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because you are overcome, crushed by the evidence.
You say nothing now, but what did you
say last year? Last year! When I think that we
could have been married since last year! A year,
a whole year lost! And it was so long, and it could
have been so short! Well, he was there, at the
Fresnes' ball. He condescended to do me the honor
of dancing three times with me. I came home intoxicated,
absolutely intoxicated with joy. But that
great happiness did not last long, for this is what
that Gontran the next day said to his friend Robert
d'Aigremont, who told his sister Gabrielle, who repeated
it to me, that he saw clearly that they wished
to marry him to his cousin Marceline. I had, the
day before, literally thrown myself into his arms;
he had thought right, from pure goodness of heart,
to show some pity for the love of the little school-girl,
so he had resolved to dance with me; but he
had done, quite done&mdash;he wouldn't be caught again.
He would keep carefully away from coming-out
balls; they were too dangerous a form of gayety.
Marriage did not tempt him in the least. He had
not had enough of a bachelor's life yet&mdash;besides, he
knew of nothing more absurd than those marriages
between cousins. The true pleasure of marriage, he
said, must be to put into one's life something new
and unexpected, and to call by her first name, all
at once, on Tuesday morning, a person whom one
didn't so call Monday night. But a person whom
one already knew well, where would be the pleasure?
He made a movement, Aunt Louise; did you
see?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I saw&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He recognized the phrase.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True. I remember&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! but you did not say that phrase only&mdash;you
said all the others. But that is nothing as yet, Aunt
Louise. Do you know what was his principal objection
to a marriage with me? Do you know what
he told Robert? That he had seen me in evening-dress
the night before for the first time, and that I
was too thin! Too thin! Ah! that was a cruel
blow to me! For it was true. I was thin. The
evening after Gabrielle had told me that awful fact,
that evening in undressing I looked at my poor little
shoulders, with their poor little salt-cellars, and
I had a terrible spasm of sorrow&mdash;a flood of tears
that wouldn't stop&mdash;a torrent, a real torrent; and
then mamma appeared. I was alone, disrobed, hair
flying, studying my shoulders, deploring their meagreness&mdash;a
true picture of despair! Mamma took
me in her arms. 'My angel, my poor dear, what is
the matter?' I answered only by sobbing. 'My
child, tell me all.' Mamma was very anxious, but
I could not speak; tears choked my voice. 'My
dearest, do you wish to kill me?' So to reassure
mamma I managed to say between my sobs: 'I
am too thin, mamma; last night Gontran thought
me too thin!' At that mamma began to laugh
heartily; but as she was good-humored that evening,
after laughing she explained to me that she,
at seventeen, had been much thinner than I, and
she promised me in the most solemn manner that
I should grow stouter. Mamma spoke true; I
have fattened up. Will you have the goodness, sir,
to declare to our aunt that the salt-cellars have entirely
disappeared, and that you cannot have against
me, in that respect, any legitimate cause of complaint?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will declare so very willingly; but you will permit
me to add&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will permit you no such thing. I have the
floor, let me speak; but you will soon have a chance
to justify yourself. I intend to put you through a
little cross-questioning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll wait, then&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, do. So last spring I began my first campaign.
I do not know, Aunt Louise, what the customs
were in your time, but I know that to-day, at
the present time, the condition of young girls is one
of extreme severity. We are kept confined, closely
confined, till eighteen, for mamma was very indulgent
in bringing me out when I was only seventeen;
but mamma is goodness itself, and then she isn't
coquettish for a sou&mdash;she didn't mind admitting that
she had a marriageable daughter. All mothers are
not like that, and I know some who are glad to put
off the public and official exhibition of their poor
children so as to gain a year. At the same time
that they race at Longchamps and Chantilly the
great fillies of the year, they take from their boxes
the great heiresses of the year who are ripe for matrimony,
and in a series of white balls given for that
purpose, between Easter Sunday and the Grand
Prix, they are made to take little trial gallops before
connoisseurs. They have to work rapidly and find
a buyer before the Grand Prix; for after that all is
up, the young girls are packed back to their governesses,
dancing-masters, and literary professors.
The campaign is over. That is all for the year.
They are not seen again, the poor things, till after
Lent. So mamma took me last year to a dozen
large balls, which were sad and sorrowful for me.
He was not there! He didn't wish to marry! He
told it to every one insolently, satirically. He
would never, never, never marry! He told it to
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At your mother's request.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that is true. I know since that it was at
mamma's petition that he talked that way; she
hoped it would prevent my being stubborn in my
craze for him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Craze!&quot; exclaimed Aunt Louise.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me, Aunt Louise, it is a word of to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And means&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It means a sort of unexplainable, absurd, and
extravagant love that comes without its being possible
to know why&mdash;in short, Aunt Louise, exactly
the love I have for him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Much obliged! But you do not tell everything.
You do not say that your mother desired your marriage
with Courtalin&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, of course; mamma was quite right. M. de
Courtalin has a thousand sterling merits that you
have not&mdash;that you will never have; and then M. de
Courtalin had a particularly good point in mamma's
eyes: he did not find me too thin, and he asked for
my hand in marriage. One day about four o'clock
(that was the 2d of June last year) mamma came
into my room with an expression on her face
I had never seen before. 'My child,' she said&mdash;'my
dear child!' She had no need to finish; I had
understood. M. de Courtalin all the evening before,
at the Princess de Viran's, had hovered about
me, and the next day his mother had come to declare
to mamma that her son knew of nothing more
delightful than my face. I answered that I knew
of nothing less delightful than M. de Courtalin's
face. I added that, besides, I was in no hurry to
marry. Mamma tried to make me hear reason. I
was going to let slip an admirable chance. The
Duke of Courtalin was the target of all the ambitious
mothers&mdash;a great name, a great position, a great
fortune! I should deeply regret some day to have
shown such disdain for advantages like these, etc.
And to all these things, which were so true and
sensible, I could find only one word to say: his
name, Gontran, Gontran, Gontran! Gontran or the
convent, and the most rigorous one of all, the Carmel,
in sackcloth and ashes! Oh, Aunt Louise, do
look at him! He listens to all this with an unbearable
little air of fatuity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have forbidden me to speak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True. Don't speak; but you have deserved a little
lesson in modesty and humility. Good gracious!
you think perhaps it was for your merits that I chose
you, insisted on you. You would be far from the
mark, my poor dear. It is, on the contrary, because
of your want of merit. Now, as to M. de Courtalin.
Why, there is a man of merit! I had, from morning
to night, M. de Courtalin's merit dinned into
my ears, and that was why I had taken a dislike to
him. What I dreaded more than anything for a
husband was what is called a superior man; and
mamma went the wrong way to work to win me
over to her candidate when she said to me: 'He is
a very intelligent, very serious, very deep-thinking,
and very distinguished man; he has spent his
youth honorably; he has been a model son, and
would make a model husband.' It made me shiver
to hear mamma talk so. I know nothing more
awful than people who are always, always right;
who, under all circumstances, give evidence of unfailing
good sense; who crush us with their superiority.
With Gontran I am easy, quite easy. It
isn't he who would crush me with his superiority.
I do not know much, Aunt Louise, but my ignorance
beside his is learning. He had great trouble
in getting his baccalaureate. He flunked three
times.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Flunked!&quot; exclaimed Aunt Louise.</p>

<p>&quot;It means failed. He taught me the word. All
the queer words I use, Aunt Louise, were taught
me by him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come, now&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, all. I can see him now, coming to the
house one day, and I can hear him say, 'Flunked
again!' That was the third time. Then he went
and took his examination in the country at a little
college at Douai; it was easier, and he passed at
last. M. de Courtalin has never been flunked; he
is everything that one can be at his age: bachelor,
advocate, lawyer, and grave, exact, and severe in
his language, and dressed&mdash;always in a black
frock-coat, with two rows of buttons, always all
buttoned&mdash;in short, a man of the past. And what a
future before him! Already a member of the General
Council, and very eloquent, very influential,
he will be deputy in three years, and then, when
we have a government that people of our class can
recognize, minister, ambassador, and I know not
what! The highest offices wait for him, and all
his ambitions will be legitimate when he has a
chance to put his superior talents at the service of
the monarchy. That's one of mamma's phrases.
Whereas you, my poor Gontran&mdash;you will never be
anything other than a very funny and very nice
old dear, whom I shall lead as I like with my little
finger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! oh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will see. Besides, you have seen for eight
days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The first eight days don't count.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will continue, rest assured. I love you, besides.
I love you, and do you know why? It is because
you are not a man of the past; you are distinctly
modern, very modern. Look at him, Aunt
Louise. Isn't he very nice, very well turned out,
very modern, in fact&mdash;I repeat it&mdash;in his little pearl-gray
suit. He is devoted to his clothes. He consults
for hours and hours with his tailor, which
delights me, for I intend to consult for hours and
hours with my dress-maker. And he will pay the
bills without a tremor, for he will be charmed to see
me very stylish and very much admired. Ah, we
shall make the most brilliant and most giddy little
couple! He is modern, I shall be modern, we shall
be modern! After three, four, or five weeks (we
do not know exactly) dedicated to pure love, we
shall take flight towards the country, where one has
a good time; and then we shall be talked about,
Aunt Louise, we shall be talked about. And now,
where was I in my story? I am sure I do not
know at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor I.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor I.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I know. Mme. de Courtalin had come to
ask my hand for her honorable son, and when
mamma had spoken to me of that I had exclaimed,
'Sooner the convent!' I do not know
exactly what mamma said to Mme. de Courtalin&mdash;at
any rate, I was left alone for the time being.
There was a rush to the Grand Prix, and then a
general breaking-up. We went to spend a month
at Aix-les-Bains for papa's complaint, and then a
fortnight here, Aunt Louise; and then, do you remember,
you received the confessions of my poor
torn heart. Ah! I must say you are the only
young member of the family&mdash;you were the only
one who did not make a long face when I spoke of
my love for that rogue. Mamma, however, had
preached to you, and you vaunted the advantages
of an alliance with Courtalin, but without conviction.
I felt that you were at bottom on my side
against mamma, and it was so easily explained&mdash;mamma
could not understand me, whereas you!
They think we little girls know nothing, and we
know everything. I knew that mamma had made a
worldly marriage, which had, however, turned out
very well; and you, Aunt Louise, had married for
love. You must have battled to get the husband
you wished, and you had him, and you resolutely
conquered your happiness. Yes, I knew all that;
I dared even to allude to those things of the past,
and those memories brought a smile to your lips
and tears to your eyes. And to-day again, Aunt
Louise, there it is, the smile, and there are the
tears.&quot;</p>

<p>Marceline interrupted her talk, affectionately
threw herself on her Aunt Louise's neck, and kissed
her with all her heart. She wiped away the tears
with kisses, and only the smile remained. Yes,
Aunt Louise remembered that she had had hard
work to get as husband a certain handsome officer
of the Royal Guard, who was there present at
the scene, in an old decorated frame, standing up
with his helmet on his head in a martial attitude,
leaning on the hilt of his cavalry sabre.</p>

<p>He, too, had been modern, that conqueror of the
Trocadero, when he entered Madrid in 1822 on the
staff of the Duke of Angoul&ecirc;me. And she, too, old
Aunt Louise, had been modern, very modern, the
day when, from a window of the Palace of the Tuileries,
during a military parade, she had murmured
this phrase in her mother's ear: &quot;Mamma, there is
the one I love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, how cowardly we are!&quot; exclaimed Marceline,
abruptly, changing her tone. &quot;Yes, how cowardly
we are to love them&mdash;those, those dreadful
men, who know so little how to care for us. I say
that for Gontran. What was he doing while I
was telling you my sorrows, Aunt Louise? Quite
calmly taking a trip around the world. But let him
speak now, let him speak, especially as I cannot
any more. In all my life I have never made so
long a speech. Speak, sir; why were you going
round the world?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because your mother, on the morning of the
day before you departed for Aix-les-Bains, had had
a very long conversation with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And she had said to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She had said to me, 'Put a stop to this; marry
her or go away, and let her not hear of you again
till her marriage.' And as I had for some time
been debating whether to take a little trip to Japan,
I started for Japan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He started for Japan! That goes without saying.
You hear him, Aunt Louise; he admits that
this time last year he preferred to expatriate himself
rather than marry me. So there he was in
America, in China, and in Japan. This lasted ten
months; from time to time, humbly and timidly, I
asked for news of him. He was very well; his
last letter was from Shanghai, or Sidney, or Java.
For me, not a word, not a remembrance&mdash;nothing,
nothing, absolutely nothing!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had promised your mother. One day at Yokohama
I had bought you a lot of fascinating little
things. The box was done up and addressed to
you when I remembered my promise. I sent all
those Japaneseries to your mother, thinking that
you would have your share of the spoil.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had nothing at all. The arrival of the box
was kept a secret. It would have been necessary
to have pronounced your name before me, and
mamma didn't wish that. On the other hand, there
was always one name on her lips&mdash;Courtalin. Still
Courtalin, and always Courtalin. He had all qualities,
all virtues. Then he had just lost his aunt
in Brittany, and he had inherited something. It
was thought that he would only have a quarter of
the property, and he had had three-quarters. Besides,
it was a country-seat, and all around this
seat, an admirable domain, sixteen or seventeen
hundred hectares. I say it to my shame, Aunt
Louise, to my great shame, the thought of giving
in came to me; and then, to be absolutely frank,
it rather pleased me to become a duchess; so
mamma made me out a list of all possible husbands
for me, and there was no other duke in the
list but M. de Courtalin. There was, of course,
the little Count of Limiers, who would be duke
some day. But when? His father is forty-five and
an athlete, and has an iron constitution. So I was
obliged to admit it when I talked it over with
mamma in the evening. To be duchess it was
necessary to agree on M. de Courtalin. Mamma,
however, was perfect, and delightfully gentle. She
did not press me, nor treat me harshly, nor torment
me; she waited. Only I knew she had said to
Mme. de Nelly: 'It will be accomplished, my dear,
before the 20th of June. It must be.' Papa
was obliged to return to Aix for his complaint.
The 20th of June was the date for his departure.
I no longer said, 'No, no, no!' with that savage
energy of the year before. You see, Gontran,
I open my whole heart to you; you will have, I
hope, soon the same courage and sincerity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You may be sure of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was waiting, however&mdash;I was waiting for his
return. I wished to have with him a very serious
conversation. It is quite true that I felt like fainting
with fear at the mere thought of that explanation;
but I was none the less resolved to speak, and
I would speak. It seemed to me impossible that
he had not thought of me sometimes out there in
China and Cochin China. We had always loved
each other (till the unhappy day on which I had
become marriageable) with a tender and faithful
affection! I knew that he would arrive in Paris
during the night of the 2d or 3d of April. Very
certainly the day after he would come and see us.
And so, in fact, towards two o'clock he came.
Mamma hadn't finished dressing; I was alone. I
ran to him. 'Ah, how glad I am to see you!' and
I kissed him with effusion. Then he, very much
moved, yes, very much moved, kissed me, and began
to say to me such nice and pretty things that I
felt my heart melting. Ah, if mamma hadn't come
for five minutes&mdash;I would only have asked for five
minutes!&mdash;and how quickly it would have turned
into love-making our little explanation!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that is true. The impulse that threw you
into my arms was so sincere. Ah, very certainly
it was that day, at that moment, that I began to love
you. And then I looked at you. You were no
longer the same. There was such great and happy
change.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He does not dare say it, Aunt Louise, but I
will say it: I had become fatter. Ah, when I
think that I might be Duchess of Courtalin if I
had remained thin. Those men! Those men!
What wretches! But mamma came in, then papa,
and then my brother George. No explanation possible!
There they all were engaged in an odious
conversation on the comparative merits of the
English and French boats&mdash;the English ones are
faster, the food on the French ones is better, etc.
It was charming! At the end of an hour Gontran
went away, but not without giving me a very tender
and eloquent hand-shake. I could wish nothing
more speaking than that hand-shake. But mamma,
who was observing us attentively, had clearly seen
our two hands, after having found a way to say
very pleasant things, had had a great deal of trouble
in separating. I expected, of course, to see him
the next day. Did you come?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the day after that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, nor then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At last, after three days, mamma took me to
the races at the Bois de Boulogne. We arrived,
and there at once, two steps from me, I saw him.
But no, it was no longer he; frigid greeting, frigid
good-day, frigid hand-shake, frigid words, and very
few of them&mdash;scarcely a few sentences, awkward
and embarrassed. Then he was lost in the crowd,
and that was all. He did not appear again. I
was dumfounded, overcome, crushed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it was your mother who&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know now; but I did not know that day.
Yes, it was mamma. Oh, must I not love mamma
to have forgiven her that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She had come to me very early in the morning
the day after the very eloquent hand-shake and
there, in tears&mdash;yes, literally in tears (she was sobbing)&mdash;she
had appealed to my sense of honor, of
delicacy, of integrity. 'You both had,' she said to
me, 'yesterday, on seeing each other again after a
long absence, a little spasm of emotion. That is
all right; but you must stop there, and not prolong
this foolishness,' And, just as I was going to protest:
'Oh yes; foolishness!' 'Remember, Marceline's
happiness is at stake. You have no right to
compromise her. You come back from China all
at once, and your abrupt return will break off more
sensible, more studied arrangements. M. de Courtalin
is thirty-four; he is a man of great knowledge
and wisdom. However, I know that that is only a
secondary consideration; but love passes away, and
money remains, and M. de Courtalin is richer, very
much richer, than you. With him Marceline will
have quite a grand position. Whereas you, you
know how I love you, and I know how worthy you
are of being loved. You are charming, charming,
charming.' It was your mother who spoke thus.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know; I know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Yes, charming; but when I have said that, I
have said all. So I will ask you this question, and
I expect from you a faithful answer: Have you
those solid qualities which alone can make a husband,
a true husband? Marceline is a little light-headed,
a little frivolous, a little coquettish.' It is
always your mother who is speaking.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know; I know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was embarrassed, Aunt Louise; it seemed to
me that that speech was not without reason. I
hadn't a very high idea of myself as a husband,
and even now I ask myself&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't ask yourself anything. Be an affectionate
husband, and you will have all the virtues.
Nothing simpler, as you see. You can go on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, your mother was so skilfully persuasive
that the day after, at the races, I gave that cold
greeting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so I, that same day, on entering the
house, threw myself into mamma's arms, exclaiming,
'Yes, I am willing to marry M. de Courtalin!'
Ah, how many times between that day and
the 16th of May I threw myself into mamma's
arms! I did nothing else. Mamma got used to
it, and never saw me appear without mechanically
opening her arms. 'Yes, I am willing,' and sometimes,
'No, I am not.' But the 'No, I am nots'
became fewer and fewer. M. de Courtalin, besides,
was perfect; a model of tact, of gentleness,
and of resignation. He waited, always in his black
frock-coat, always buttoned, with an inexhaustible
patience. Mamma was, in short, pledged to Mme.
de Courtalin, and I felt the circle tighten round
me. The papers announced, in a covert but transparent
way, that there was question of an alliance
between two families of the Faubourg Saint-Germain,
and they made it pretty clear that it concerned
two important families. I already received
vague congratulations, and I dared respond only
by vague denials. The morning of the famous
17th of May mamma had said to me, 'Come,
my child, don't make a martyr of that poor boy.
Since it is to be &quot;yes,&quot; for it will be &quot;yes,&quot; you
know yourself, say &quot;yes&quot; at once.' I had obtained
only a miserable respite of twenty-four
hours; and things were thus when, still on the 17th
of May, mamma and I arrived, a little late (after
eleven), at Mme. de Vernieux's, who was giving a
ball, a very large ball. I went in, and I had at
once the feeling that I must be looking extremely
well that evening. They formed into a little
hedge along my way, and I heard a little 'oh!'
of surprise, and a big 'ah!' of admiration which
went straight to my heart. I had had already in
society certain successes, but never any as marked
as that one. M. de Courtalin came towards me.
He wished to engage me for all the waltzes, for all
the quadrilles, for the entire evening, for the night,
for life. I answered him: 'Later, presently, we will
see. I feel a little tired.' The fact was I hadn't
the heart to dance. Mamma and I took our seats.
A waltz began. Mamma scolded softly: 'Dance
with him, my child, I beg.' I didn't listen to her.
I was abstractedly looking around the room when
suddenly I saw in a corner two eyes fixed, fastened,
pinioned on me&mdash;two eyes that I well knew, but
that I had some difficulty in recognizing, for they
were tremendously enlarged by a sort of stupor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say by overwhelming admiration.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you please But it is here, Aunt Louise,
that my interrogation will begin. Why and how
were you there? Where had you dined, Gontran?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At the club.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what did you intend to do after dinner?
Come to Mme. de Vernieux's?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; Robert d'Aigremont and I had meant to
go to the Bouffes-Parisiens.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did not go? Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We had telephoned from the club to have a
box; all were sold&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you said to Robert&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said to Robert, 'Let's play bezique;' and I
was beaten by one of those streaks of bad luck&mdash;34,000
points in a dozen games&mdash;so thoroughly
that towards half-past ten I thought that bezique
had lasted long enough&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So Robert wished to bring you to Mme. de
Vernieux's. And you didn't want to go! If
you hadn't come, however, and if there had been
a box at the Bouffes-Parisiens, or if you had won
at bezique, my marriage with M. de Courtalin
would have been publicly announced the next day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but I came; and there I was in the corner
looking at you, looking at you, looking at you.
It was you, and yet not you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I, immediately on seeing the way you were looking
at me, understood that something extraordinary
was going to happen. Your eyes shone, burned,
blazed!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I had discovered that you were simply
the prettiest woman of the ball, where all the prettiest
women of Paris were. Yes, the prettiest, and
such shoulders, such shoulders!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ripe! in fact, I was ripe!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My head was turned at once. I saw Courtalin
manoeuvring and trying to get near you. I understood
that there was not a moment to be lost. To
reach there ahead of Courtalin I threw myself intrepidly
into the midst of the room, among the waltzers,
pushing and being pushed. I forged a passage
and tore into rags one of the lace flounces of Mme.
de Lornans&mdash;she hasn't yet forgiven me. But I
got there&mdash;I got there before Courtalin, and threw
myself on you, and took you round your waist
(I can still hear your little cry), and I dragged
you off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mamma had scarcely time to scream 'Marceline,
Marceline!' when I was there no more. He
had lifted me off, and carried me away; and we
were waltzing wildly, furiously!&mdash;oh, what a waltz!&mdash;and
he was saying to me: 'I love you! I adore
you! You are grace and beauty itself! There is
only one pretty woman here&mdash;you; and it is I who
will be your husband. I, do you hear? I, and not
another!' And I, quite suffocated with surprise,
pleasure, and emotion, allowed myself to be nearly
carried by him, but I kept begging him to speak
lower. 'Anything you wish; yes, I will be your
wife; but take care&mdash;you will be heard&mdash;you will be
heard.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is what I wished; and I continued, 'I love
you! I adore you!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I, absolutely breathless: 'Not so fast.
I pray, not so fast; I shall fall. I assure you everything
is going round, everything is going round.
Let us stop.' 'No, no; don't let's stop. Keep on
still. If we stop your mother will separate us, and
I have still so many things to say to you&mdash;so many
things, so many things. Swear to me that you will
be my wife.' 'Yes, I swear it; but enough, enough&mdash;'
I was smothering. He heard nothing. He was
going, going like a madman. We had become a
hurricane, a whirlwind, a cyclone. We caused surprise
and fright. No one danced any more, but
looked at us. And he held me so close, and his
face was so near my face, his lips so near my lips,
that all at once I felt myself giving way. I slipped,
and let myself into his arms. A cloud passed
before my eyes; I could not speak nor think;
then blankness. Everything had disappeared before
me in a vertigo not too disagreeable, I must
say. I had fainted, absolutely fainted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The next day our marriage was decided, perfectly
decided. Our waltz had caused scandal.
That was just what I wanted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There, Aunt Louise, is the history of our marriage,
and I want to-day to draw this conclusion:
it is that I was the first to begin to love, and I shall
have, consequently, one day, when it pleases me,
the right to stop the first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, no, indeed; tell her, Aunt Louise, that she
will never have that right&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>A new quarrel threatened to break out.</p>

<p>&quot;This, my children,&quot; said the old aunt, &quot;is all I
have to say: she did, in truth, start the first to love;
but it seems to me, Gontran, that you started all at
once at such a great pace that you must have
caught up with her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Passed her, Aunt Louise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no!&quot; exclaimed Marceline.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; continued Aunt Louise, &quot;try never to
have any other quarrels than that one. Try to walk
always in life step by step, side by side, and heart
to heart. I have seen many inventions since I was
born, and the world is no longer what it was then.
But there is one thing to which inventions have
made no difference, and never will. That thing
you have; keep it. It is love! Love each other,
children, as strongly and as long as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>And Aunt Louise wept another tear, and smiled
on looking at the portrait of the officer of the Royal
Guard.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DANCING_MASTER" id="THE_DANCING_MASTER"></a>THE DANCING-MASTER</h2>


<p>I was dining at the house of some friends, and
in the course of the evening the hostess said to me:</p>

<p>&quot;Do you often go to the opera?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, very often.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And do you go behind the scenes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I go behind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you can do me a favor. In the ballet
department there's an old man called Morin, who
is perfectly respectable, it seems. He is the little
B&mdash;&mdash;'s dancing-master. He gives excellent lessons.
I should like to have him for my little girls,
so ask him if he could come twice a week.&quot;</p>

<p>I willingly undertook the delicate mission.</p>

<p>The next day, February 17, 1881, about ten in
the evening, I arrived at the opera, and went behind
the scenes to search for Monsieur Morin.
&quot;The Prophet&quot; was being played, and the third
act had just begun. On the stage the Anabaptists
were singing forcibly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Du sang! que Judas succombe!<br /></span>
<span>Du sang! Dansons sur leur tombe!<br /></span>
<span>Du sang! Voila l'h&eacute;catombe<br /></span>
<span>Que Dieu nous demande encor!&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Axes were raised over the heads of a crowd
of hapless prisoners, who were barons, bishops,
monks, and grand ladies. In the wings, balanced
on their skates, all the ballet-girls were waiting the
right moment to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Effleurer la glace<br /></span>
<span>Sans laisser de trace.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I respectfully begged one of the young Westphalian
peasant-girls to point out to me the man
named Morin.</p>

<p>&quot;Morin,&quot; she replied, &quot;is not one of the skaters.
Look, he is on the stage. That's he over there, the
one who is doing the bishop; that bishop, you see,
who is being pushed and pulled. Wait, he will be
off directly.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the Anabaptist leaders intervened, however,
declaring that the nobles and priests who
could pay ransom should be spared. Morin escaped
with his life, and I had the honor of being
presented to him by the little Westphalian peasant-girl.</p>

<p>He had quite a venerable air, with his long gray
beard and his fine purple robe with his large pastoral
cross. While he was arranging somewhat
his costume, which had been so roughly pulled by
those violent Anabaptists, I asked him if he would
be willing to give lessons to two young girls of
good family.</p>

<p>The pious bishop accepted with alacrity. His
price was ten francs an hour.</p>

<p>The little skaters had gone on the stage, and
were performing wonderful feats. The wings had
suddenly become calm and silent. We gave ourselves
up, his Reverence and myself, to a little
friendly chat.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; his Highness said to me, &quot;I give
dancing lessons. I have many patrons among the
aristocracy and the bankers. I have no reason to
complain; and yet one must admit things were
better once, much better. Dancing is going out,
sir, dancing is going out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it possible?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is as I have the honor of telling you. Women
still learn to dance; but no longer the young
men, sir, no longer. Baccarat, races, and the minor
theatres&mdash;that's what they enjoy. It's a little the
fault of the Government.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How can that be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;M. Jules Ferry has recently rearranged the
curriculum of the University. He has made certain
studies obligatory&mdash;modern languages, for instance.
I don't blame him for that; the study of
modern languages has great advantages. But dancing,
sir; nothing has been done for dancing, and it
is dancing which ought, after all, to have been made
obligatory. There ought to be a dancing-master
in every high-school, and a normal-school for
dancing with examinations and competitions in
dancing. Dancing ought to be studied the same
as Latin or Greek. Dancing, too, is a language,
and a language that every well-bred man ought to
be able to speak. Well, do you know what happens
nowadays? Sometimes it happens, sir, that diplomatic
posts are given to people who get confused
in the figures of a quadrille, and who are incapable
of waltzing for two minutes. They know very well
that their education is incomplete. Quite lately a
young man came to me&mdash;a young man of great
merit, it seems, except in regard to dancing. He
had just been attached to a great embassy. He
had never danced in his life&mdash;never. Do you understand?
Never! It is scarcely to be credited, and
yet it is true. That's the way M. Barth&eacute;l&eacute;my-Saint-Hilaire
picks them out. Oh, this beard smothers
me! Will you permit me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

<p>He took off his gray beard, and thus looked much
less venerable. He then continued:</p>

<p>&quot;I said to this young man: 'We will try, but it
will be hard work. One oughtn't to begin dancing
at twenty-eight.' I limbered him up as best I could.
I had only two weeks to do it in. I begged him to
put off his departure, to obtain a reprieve of three
or four months&mdash;I could have made something of
him. He would not. He went without knowing
anything. I often think of him. He will represent
us out there; he will represent us very badly; he will
not be an honor to his country. Please to remember
that he may be called upon to take part in some
official quadrille&mdash;to dance, for instance, with an
archduchess. Well, if he slips up in it, with his
archduchess, it will be charming! All this is very
sad indeed. I am a Republican, sir, an old Republican,
and it is painful to think that the republic is
represented by diplomats who cannot distinguish
between a change of foot and a simple step. Do
you know what is said in foreign courts? 'Why,
who are those savages that France sends us?'
Yes, that's what they say. The diplomatic corps
in the time of the Empire was not brilliant. Oh
no; those gentlemen did many foolish things. Oh
yes; but still they knew how to dance!&quot;</p>

<p>And the good old bishop, seeing that I listened
with much interest, went on with his brilliant improvisation.</p>

<p>&quot;Dancing, sir, is not merely a pleasure, an amusement;
no, it is of great social interest. Why, the
question of marriage is closely connected with dancing.
At present, in France, marriage is languishing.
That is proved by statistics. Well, I am convinced
that if there are fewer marriages it is because
there is less dancing. Consider this first of all,
that to know how to dance well, very well, is, for
an agreeable young man who is without fortune,
a great advantage in society. One of my pupils,
sir, has recently married extremely well. He was
a very ordinary kind of youth, who had tried everything
and had succeeded in nothing; but he was a
first-rate waltzer, and he danced away with two
millions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two millions!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, two millions, and they were two cash millions;
she was an orphan, no father nor mother&mdash;all
that can be dreamed of. He clasped that young
lady (she was very plump). Well, in his arms, she
felt herself light as a feather. She thought of but
one thing&mdash;waltzing with him. She was as one
wild. He gave her a new sensation, and what is
it women desire above all things? To have new
sensations, in short, she refused marquises, counts,
and millionaires. She wanted him only. She got
him, and he was penniless, and his name is Durand.
Ah, do not repeat his name; I oughtn't to
have told you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all, you can repeat it; it doesn't matter, it's
such a common name. There is public policy in love-matches
which cause a rich girl to marry a poor
man, or a poor girl to marry a rich man. It sets
money circulating, it prevents its remaining in the
same place, it keeps capital moving. Well, three-fourths
of the love-matches were formerly made
by the dance. Now there are short interviews in
parlors, in galleries, and at the Op&eacute;ra Comique.
They chat; that's all right, but chatting is not
sufficient. Wit is something, but not everything.
A waltz furnishes much knowledge that conversation
cannot. Dress-makers nowadays are so
wily. They know how to bring out this point and
hide that; they remodel bad figures. They give
plumpness and roundness to the thin; they make
hips, shoulders&mdash;everything, in fact. One doesn't
know what to expect, science has made such advances.
The eye may be deceived, but the hand
of an experienced dancer never! A waltzer with
tact knows how to find out the exact truth about
things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! oh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Remaining all the time, sir, perfectly respectful
and perfectly reserved. Good heavens! look at
myself, for instance. It is to waltzing that I owe
my happiness. Mme. Morin was not then Mme.
Morin. I kept my eye on her, but I hesitated.
She appeared thin, and&mdash;well, I'll admit that to
marry a thin woman didn't suit my ideas. You
know every one has his ideals. So, sir, I was
still hesitating, when one evening, at the wedding
of one of my friends, a very capable young man,
a deputy manager of a department at the Ministry
of Religion, they started a little dance. For
the first waltz I asked the one who was to be my
companion through life. Immediately I felt in my
hand a delightful figure&mdash;one of those full but supple
figures; and while waltzing, quite enchanted, I
was saying to myself, 'She isn't really thin! she
isn't really thin!' I took her back to her place
after the waltz, and went at once to her mother to
ask for her hand, which was granted me. For fourteen
years I have been the happiest of men, and
perhaps I shouldn't have made that marriage if I
hadn't known how to waltz. You see, sir, the results
of a waltz?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perfectly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is not all, sir. Thanks to dancing, one
discovers not only the agreeable points of a person,
the fulness of her figure, the lithesomeness of
her waist, but also, in a briskly led waltz, a little
examination of the health and constitution of a
woman can be had. I remember one evening
twelve or so years ago&mdash;in the Rue Le Peletier, in
the old Op&eacute;ra-house, which has burned down&mdash;I
was on the stage awaiting my cue for the dance
in 'William Tell,' you know, in the third act. Two
subscribers were talking quite close to me, in the
wings. One of the gentlemen was an old pupil of
mine. I have had so many pupils! Without wishing
to, I heard scraps of the conversation, and these
two sentences struck my ear: 'Well, have you decided?'
'Oh,' replied my pupil, 'I find her very
charming, but I have heard that she is weak in the
lungs.' Then, sir, I did a very unusual thing for
me. I begged pardon for having heard unintentionally,
and I said to my old pupil: 'I think I
have guessed that a marriage is in question. Will
you authorize me to give you a piece of advice&mdash;advice
drawn from the practice of my profession?
Do they allow this young lady to waltz?' You know
there are mothers who do not permit&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, I know.&quot;</p>


<p>We had arrived at this point in that interesting
conversation when the ballet ended. The bishop
and myself were assailed by an actual whirlwind
of skaters, and my little Westphalian peasant-girl
found me where she had left me.</p>

<p>&quot;I declare!&quot; she said to me, &quot;so you come to
confess at the opera? Give him absolution, Morin,
and give it to me, too. Now then, come along
to the greenroom.&quot;</p>

<p>She took my arm, and we went off together, while
the excellent Morin, with gravity and dignity beneath
his sacred ornaments, withstood the shock
of this avalanche of dancers.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CIRCUS_CHARGER" id="THE_CIRCUS_CHARGER"></a>THE CIRCUS CHARGER</h2>


<p>After George had related how he had been married
off at twenty-two by his aunt, the Baroness
de Stilb, Paul said: &quot;<i>I</i> was married off by a circus
charger. I was very nearly forty years of age, and
I felt so peacefully settled in my little bachelor
habits that, in the best faith in the world, on all
occasions, I swore by the gods never to run the
great risk of marriage; but I reckoned without the
circus charger.</p>

<p>&quot;It was in the last days of September, 1864. I
had just arrived from Baden-Baden, and my intention
was to spend only twenty-four hours in Paris.
I had invited four or five of my friends&mdash;Calli&egrave;res,
Bernheim, Frondeville, and Valreas&mdash;to my place in
Poitou for the shooting season. They were to
come in the first part of October, and it needed a
week to put all in order at Roche-Targ&eacute;. A letter
from my overseer awaited me in Paris, and the
letter brought disastrous news; the dogs were well,
but out of the dozen hunting horses that I had
there, five, during my sojourn at Baden, had fallen
sick or lame, and I found myself absolutely forced
to get new horses.</p>

<p>&quot;I made a tour of the Champs-Elys&eacute;es sellers,
who showed me as hunters a fine collection of
broken&mdash;down skeletons. Average price, three
thousand francs. Roulette had treated me badly of
late, and I was neither in the humor, nor had I the
funds, to spend in that way seven or eight hundred
louis in a morning.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a Wednesday, and Ch&eacute;ri was holding his
first autumn sale. I went to the Rue de Ponthieu
during the day; and there out of the lot, on chance,
without inquiry, blindly, by good-luck, and from
the mere declarations of the catalogue&mdash;'<i>Excellent
hunter, good jumper, has hunted with lady rider</i>,' etc.&mdash;I
bought eight horses, which only cost me five
thousand francs. Out of eight, I said to myself,
there will always be four or five who will go, and
who will be good enough to serve as remounts.</p>

<p>&quot;Among the horses there was one that I had
bought, I must confess, particularly on account of
his coat, which was beautiful. The catalogue did
not attribute to him any special qualifications for
hunting, but limited itself to '<i>Brutus, riding horse</i>.'
He was a large dapple-gray horse, but never, I
think, have I seen gray better dappled; the white
coat was strewn almost regularly with beautiful
black spots, which were well distributed and well
marked.</p>

<p>&quot;I left town the next day for Roche-Targ&eacute;, and
the following day, early, they announced to me that
the horses had arrived. I at once went down to
see them, and my first glance was at Brutus. He
had been trotting in my head for forty-eight hours,
that devil of a gray horse, and I had a singular
desire to know what he was and of what he was
capable.</p>

<p>&quot;I had him taken out of the stable first. A
groom led him to me with a strap. The horse had
long teeth, hollows in the chest, lumpy fetlocks&mdash;in
short, all the signs of respectable age; but he had
powerful shoulders, a large breast, a neck which
was both strong and supple, head well held, tail
well placed, and an irreproachable back. It wasn't,
however, all this that attracted most my attention.
What I admired above all was the air with which
Brutus looked at me, and with what an attentive,
intelligent, and curious eye he followed my movements
and gestures. Even my words seemed to
interest him singularly; he inclined his head to my
side as if to hear me, and, as soon as I had finished
speaking, he neighed joyously in answer.</p>

<p>&quot;They showed me successively the seven other
horses; I examined them rapidly and absent-mindedly.
They were horses like all other horses.
Brutus certainly had something in particular, and I
was anxious to make in his company a short jaunt
in the country. He allowed himself to be saddled,
bridled, and mounted like a horse who knows his
business, and so we both started in the quietest
way in the world.</p>

<p>&quot;I had at first ridden him with the snaffle, and
Brutus had gone off at a long easy gait, with
rather a stiff neck and projected head; but as
soon as I let him feel the curb, he changed with
extraordinary rapidity and suppleness, drawing his
head back to his breast, and champing his bit noisily;
then at the same time he took a short gait,
which was light and even, lifting well his feet and
striking the sod with the regularity of a pendulum.</p>

<p>&quot;Ch&eacute;ri's catalogue had not lied; the horse was a
good rider&mdash;too good a rider, in fact. I made him
trot, then gallop; the horse at the first suggestion
gave me an excellent little trot and an excellent little
gallop, but always plunging to the ground and
pulling my arms when I tried to lift his head.
When I wished to quicken his gait, the horse
broke at once. He began to rack in great style,
trotting with the fore-feet and galloping with the
hind ones. 'Well,' I said to myself, 'I see now;
I've bought some old horse of the Saumur or
Saint-Cyr school, and it's not on this beast that
I'll hunt in eight days.'</p>

<p>&quot;I was about to turn and go home, quite edified
as to Brutus's qualities, when the report of a gun
was heard twenty yards away in the woods. It
was one of my keepers who was shooting a rabbit,
and who received some time after a handsome
present from my wife for that shot.</p>

<p>&quot;I was then in the centre of the cross-roads, which
formed a perfect circle of five or six yards in radius;
six long green alleys came to an end at this
spot. On hearing the report, Brutus had stopped
short, planted himself on his four legs, with ears
erect and head raised. I was surprised to find the
horse so impressionable. I should have thought
that after the brilliant education that very certainly
he had received in his youth, Brutus must be an
artillery horse, used to gun and cannon. I drew in
my legs to urge the horse on, but Brutus didn't
move; I spurred him sharply twice, but Brutus
didn't move; I whipped him soundly, but Brutus
didn't move. I tried to back the horse, to push him
to the right, to the left, but I couldn't move him in
the slightest degree. Brutus seemed glued to the
ground, and yet&mdash;don't you dare to laugh, and be
assured that my tale is absolutely true&mdash;each time
that I attempted to put the horse in motion he
turned his head and looked at me with an expression
which could clearly be read as impatience
and surprise; then he would again become as immovable
as a statue. There was evidently some
misunderstanding between the horse and myself.
I saw that in his eyes, and Brutus said to me, with
all the clearness he could put in his expression, 'I,
as a horse, am doing my duty, and it's you, as a
rider, who are not doing yours!'</p>

<p>&quot;I was more puzzled than embarrassed. 'What
extraordinary kind of a horse have I bought at
Ch&eacute;ri's,' I said to myself, 'and why does he look
at me so queerly?' I was, however, going to take
strong measures&mdash;that is to say, I was preparing to
whip him smartly&mdash;when another report was heard.</p>

<p>&quot;Then the horse gave a jump. I thought I had
the best of it, and, profiting by his bound, I tried
to carry him forward with hand and knee. But
no; he stopped short after his bound, and again
planted himself on the ground more energetically
and more resolutely than the first time. Ah, then
I grew angry, and my whip came into play; I
grasped it firmly and began to strike the horse
with all my strength to the right and left. But
Brutus, he too lost patience, and, instead of the
cold and immovable opposition that at first he
had shown, I met with furious retaliations, strange
springs, bucking, extraordinary rearing, fantastic
whirling; and in the midst of this battle, while the
infatuated horse bounded and reared, while I, exasperated,
struck with vigor the leather pommel
with my broken whip, Brutus still found time to
give me glances not only of surprise and impatience,
but also of anger and indignation. While I
was asking the horse for the obedience which he
refused me, it is certain that he expected from me
something that I was not doing.</p>

<p>&quot;How did it end? To my shame, to my great
shame, I was pitifully unhorsed by an incomparable
feat! Brutus understood, I think, that he
would not get the better of me by violence, and
judged it necessary to try cunning; after a pause
which was most certainly a moment of reflection,
the horse rose up, head down, upright on his fore-feet,
with the skill, the calm, and the perfect
equilibrium of a clown who walks on his hands.
Thus I tumbled into the sand, which, by good-luck,
was thick in that spot.</p>

<p>&quot;I tried to get up. I screamed and fell back ridiculously,
flat on my stomach, on my nose. At the
slightest movement I felt as though a knife ran
through my left leg. It's a slight matter, however&mdash;the
rupture of a slender sinew; but though slight, the
injury was none the less painful. I succeeded, nevertheless,
in turning over and sitting up; but just
when, while rubbing my eyes, filled with sand, I
was beginning to ask myself what in the midst of
this tumult had become of my miserable dapple-gray,
I saw over my head a large horse's hoof
descending. Then this large hoof pressed, with a
certain gentleness, however, on my chest, and
pushed me delicately back on the ground, on my
back this time.</p>

<p>&quot;I was greatly discouraged; and feeling incapable
of another effort, I remained in that position,
continuing to ask myself what sort of a horse I had
bought at Ch&eacute;ri's, closing my eyes, and awaiting
death.</p>

<p>&quot;Suddenly I heard a curious trampling around
me; a quantity of little hard things struck me on
the face. I opened my eyes, and perceived Brutus,
who, with his fore-feet and hind-legs, was trying with
incredible activity and prodigious skill to bury me
in the sand. He was doing his best, poor beast,
and from time to time he stopped to gaze at his
work; then, raising his head, he neighed and began
his work again. That lasted for a good three
or four minutes, after which Brutus, judging me
doubtless sufficiently interred, placed himself very
respectfully on his knees before my tomb&mdash;on his
knees, literally on his knees! He was saying, I
suppose, a little prayer. I looked at him. It interested
me extremely.</p>

<p>&quot;His prayer finished, Brutus made a slight bow,
went off a few steps, stopped, then, beginning to
gallop, made at least twenty times the circuit of the
open space in the middle of which he had buried
me. Brutus galloped very well, with even stride,
head well held, on the right foot, making around
me a perfect circle. I followed him with my eyes,
but it made me uneasy to see him go round and
round and round. I had the strength to cry
'Stop! stop!' The horse stopped and seemed
embarrassed, without doubt asking himself what
there was still to be done; but he perceived my
hat, which in my fall had got separated from me,
and at once made a new resolution: he walked
straight to the hat, seized it in his teeth, and galloped
off, this time by one of the six alleys that led
from my tomb.</p>

<p>&quot;Brutus got farther and farther away, and disappeared;
I remained alone. I was puzzled, positively
puzzled. I shook off the little coating of
dust which covered me, and without getting up, by
the help of my two arms and right leg&mdash;to move
my left leg was not to be thought of&mdash;I succeeded
in dragging myself to a little grassy slope on the
edge of one of the alleys. Once there, I could sit
down, after a fashion, and I began to shout with
all the strength of my lungs, 'Hi, there! hi! hi,
there!' No answer. The woods were absolutely
deserted and still. The only thing to be done
was to wait till some one passed by to aid me.</p>

<p>&quot;For half an hour I had been in that hateful position
when I perceived in the distance, at the very
end of the same alley by which he had gone off,
Brutus coming back, with the same long gallop he
had used in going. A great cloud of dust accompanied
the horse. Little by little, in that cloud, I
perceived a tiny carriage&mdash;a pony-carriage; then
in that little pony-carriage a woman, who drove
herself, and behind the woman a small groom.</p>

<p>&quot;A few moments later Brutus, covered with foam,
stopped before me, let my hat drop at my feet and
neighed, as though to say, 'I've done my duty; here
is help.' But I no longer bothered myself about
Brutus and the explanations that he made me. My
only thoughts were for the fairy who was to relieve
me, and who, after lightly jumping from her little
carriage, was coming quickly towards me. Besides,
she, too, was examining me curiously, and all at
once we both exclaimed, at the same time:</p>

<p>&quot;'Mme. de Noriolis!'</p>

<p>&quot;'M. de La Roche-Targ&eacute;!'</p>

<p>&quot;A little while ago George spoke to us of his
aunt, and mentioned how she had married him quite
young, at one stroke, without giving him time to
reflect or breathe. I, too, have an aunt, and between
us for a number of years there has been a
perpetual battle. 'Marry.' 'I don't want to marry.'
'Do you want young girls? There is Mademoiselle
A, Mademoiselle B, Mademoiselle C.'
'I don't want to marry.' 'Do you want widows?
There is Madame D, Madame E, Madame F.' 'I
don't want to marry.'</p>

<p>&quot;Mme. de Noriolis figured always in the first rank
in the series of widows, and I noticed that my aunt
put stress, with evident favoritism, on all the good
points and advantages that I should find in that
marriage. She didn't have to tell me that Mme. de
Noriolis was very pretty&mdash;any one could see that;
or that she was very rich&mdash;I knew it already. But
she explained to me that M. de Noriolis was an
idiot, who had had the merit of making his wife
perfectly miserable, and that thus it would be very
easy for the second husband to make himself very
much loved.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, when she had discoursed at length on the
virtues, graces, and merits of Mme. de Noriolis,
my aunt, who is clever and knows my weakness,
pulled out of her desk a topographical map, and
spread it out with care on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;It was the map of the district of Chatellerault,
a very correct and minute map, that my aunt had
gone herself to the military station to buy, with the
view of convincing me that I ought to marry Mme.
de Noriolis. The places of Noriolis and of La
Roche-Targ&eacute; were scarcely three kilometers apart
in that map. My aunt, with her own hands, had
drawn a line of red ink, and slily united the two
places, and she forced me to look at her little red
line, saying to me, 'Two thousand acres without a
break, when the places of Noriolis and La Roche-Targ&eacute;
are united; what a chance for a hunter!'</p>

<p>&quot;I closed my eyes, so strong was the temptation,
and repeated my refrain, 'I don't want to marry.'
But I was afraid, seriously afraid; and when I met
Mme. de Noriolis I always saw her surrounded,
as by a halo, by the little red line of my aunt, and
I said to myself: 'A charming, and clever, and
sensible woman, whose first husband was an idiot,
and this and that, and two thousand acres without
a break. Run away, wretch, run away, since you
don't wish to marry.'</p>

<p>&quot;And I ran away! But this time by what means
could I run away? I was there, miserable, in the
grass, covered with sand, with my hair in disorder,
my clothes in rags, and my unfortunate leg stiff.
And Mme. de Noriolis came nearer, looking spick
and span&mdash;always in the halo of the little red
line&mdash;and said to me:</p>

<p>&quot;'You, M. de La Roche-Targ&eacute;, is it you? What
are you doing there? What has happened to you?'</p>

<p>&quot;I frankly confessed my fall.</p>

<p>&quot;'At least you are not wounded?'</p>

<p>&quot;'No, no, I'm not wounded. I've something the
matter with that leg; but it's nothing serious, I
know.'</p>

<p>&quot;'And what horse played you that trick?'</p>

<p>&quot;'Why, this one.'</p>

<p>&quot;And I pointed out Brutus to Mme. de Noriolis.
Brutus was there, quite near us, untied, peacefully
crunching little tufts of broom.</p>

<p>&quot;'What, that one, that brave horse? Oh, he has
well made up for his faults, I assure you. I will
tell you about it, but later on. You must first get
home, and at once.'</p>

<p>&quot;'I can't walk a step.'</p>

<p>&quot;'But I am going to take you back myself, at the
risk of compromising you.'</p>

<p>&quot;And she called Bob, her little groom, and taking
me gently by the arm, while Bob took me by the
other, she made me get into her carriage; five minutes
later we were bowling off, both of us, in the
direction of La Roche-Targ&eacute;: she, holding the reins
and driving the pony with a light hand; I, looking
at her, feeling troubled, confused, embarrassed,
ridiculous, and stupid. We were alone in the carriage.
Bob was commissioned to bring Brutus,
who, very docile, had allowed himself to be taken.</p>

<p>&quot;'Lie down,' Mme. de Noriolis said to me; 'keep
your leg straight; I am going to drive you slowly
so as to avoid bumps.'</p>

<p>&quot;In short, she made a lot of little amiable and
pleasant remarks; then, when she saw me well settled,
she said:</p>

<p>&quot;'Tell me how you came to fall, and then I will
tell you how I happened to come to your aid. It
seems to me this horse story must be queer.'</p>

<p>&quot;I began my tale; but as soon as I spoke of
Brutus's efforts to unhorse me, and the two reports
of the gun, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&quot;'I understand, I understand. You have bought
a circus charger.'</p>

<p>&quot;'A circus charger!'</p>

<p>&quot;'Why, yes; that's it, and that explains everything.
You have seen twenty times at the Circus of
the Empress the performance of the circus charger&mdash;the
light-cavalryman who enters the arena on a
gray horse, then the Arabs come and shoot at the
cavalryman, who is wounded and falls; and as you
didn't fall, the horse, indignant and not understanding
how you could so far forget your part, threw
you on the ground. And when you were on the
ground, what did the horse do?'</p>

<p>&quot;I related Brutus's little work in burying me suitably.</p>

<p>&quot;'The circus charger,' she continued; 'still the
circus charger. He sees his master wounded, the
Arabs could come back and finish him, and so what
does the horse do? He buries the cavalryman.
Then goes off galloping, didn't he?'</p>

<p>&quot;'Yes, on a hard gallop,'</p>

<p>&quot;'Carrying the flag, which is not to fall into the
hands of the Arabs.'</p>

<p>&quot;'It's my hat that he took.'</p>

<p>&quot;'He took what he could. And where does the
circus charger gallop to?'</p>

<p>&quot;'Ah! I know, I know,' I exclaimed, in my turn,
'he goes to get the sutler.'</p>

<p>&quot;'Precisely. He goes to get the sutler; and the
sutler to-day, if you please, is I, Countess of Noriolis.
Your big gray horse galloped into my grounds.
I was standing on the porch, putting on my gloves
and ready to step into my carriage, when the stablemen
came running, upon seeing that horse arrive
saddled and bridled, without a rider, and a
hat in his mouth. They tried to catch him, but
he shunned them and escaped, and came straight
to the porch, falling on his knees before me. The
men approached, and once more tried to catch him;
but he got up, galloped away, stopped by the gate
of the grounds, turned around, and looked at me.
He called to me&mdash;I assure you, he called to me. I
told the men not to bother about the horse any
more. Then I jumped into my carriage and started;
the horse rushed into the woods; post-haste I followed
him by paths that were not always intended
for carriages; but still I followed him, and I arrived
and found you.'</p>

<p>&quot;At the moment Mme. de Noriolis was speaking
those last words the carriage received a tremendous
shock from behind; then we saw in the air Brutus's
head, which was held there upright as though by a
miracle. For it was again Brutus. Mounted by
Bob, he had followed the carriage for several minutes,
and seeing that the back seat of the little pony-carriage
was unoccupied, he had, like a true artist,
cleverly seized the moment to give us a new proof
of his talent in executing the most brilliant of his
former performances. In one jump he had placed
his fore-feet on the carriage, then, that done, he
quietly continued trotting on his two hind-legs.
Bob, distracted, with his body thrown over and his
head thrown back, was making vain attempts to put
the horse back on his four legs.</p>

<p>&quot;As to Mme. de Noriolis, she was so well frightened,
that, letting the reins drop from her hands,
she had simply thrown herself in my arms. Her
adorable little head had rolled hap-hazard on my
shoulder, and my lips just touched her hair. With
my left hand I tried to recover the reins, with my
right I supported Mme. de Noriolis; my leg hurt
me frightfully, and I was seized with a queer feeling
of confusion.</p>

<p>&quot;It was thus that Mme. de Noriolis made her
first entry into La Roche-Targ&eacute;.</p>

<p>&quot;When she returned there, one evening at midnight,
six weeks later, having during the day become
Mme. de La Roche-Targ&eacute;, she said:</p>

<p>&quot;'What is life, after all? Nothing like this would
have happened if you hadn't bought the circus
charger.'&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="BLACKY" id="BLACKY"></a>BLACKY</h2>


<p>&quot;Don't be alarmed, sir; you won't miss the
train. For the last fifteen years I've been carrying
travellers to the station, and I've never yet missed
a train! Think of that, sir; never!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, don't look at your watch. There is one
thing you don't know and that you must learn,
and that your watch will never be able to tell you&mdash;that
is, that the train is always a quarter of an
hour late. Such a thing as the train's being on
time has never happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Such a thing happened that day, however, for
the train was on time, and so I missed it. My
driver was furious.</p>

<p>&quot;You should warn us,&quot; he said to the station-master,
&quot;if your trains are suddenly going to start
at the right hour. Who ever saw the like!&quot;</p>

<p>And he turned to one or two of the porters for
witnesses.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you ever see such a thing? I don't wish
to appear blamable before the gentleman. A train
on time&mdash;on time! You know it's the first time it
has ever happened.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a general cry of &quot;Yes, indeed; usually
there's some delay.&quot; But, for all that, I had none
the less three long hours to pass in a very desolate
village (in the Canton of Vaud) shut in by two
sad-looking mountains, which had their little topknots
covered with snow.</p>

<p>But how kill three hours? In my turn I now
asked advice, and again there was a chorus of
&quot;Go see the Caldron; that's the only sight to be
seen in this part of the country.&quot; &quot;And where
is this Caldron?&quot; On the mountain, to the right,
half way up; but the path was a little complicated,
and I was advised to take a guide; and there,
over there in that white cottage with green blinds,
I would find the best guide there was about here,
an honest man&mdash;Old Simon.</p>

<p>So I went and knocked at the door of the little
house.</p>

<p>An old woman opened it.</p>

<p>&quot;Simon, the guide?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, right here; but&mdash;if it's to go to the Caldron&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is to go to the Caldron.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Simon hasn't been very well since morning;
he hasn't much strength, and he can't go
out. But don't worry yourself; there is some one
who can replace him&mdash;there is Blacky.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right, let it be Blacky, then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only I must tell you that Blacky isn't a person.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a person?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, he's our dog.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A dog? What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Blacky; and he will guide you very well&mdash;quite
as well as my husband. He is in the habit
of&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the habit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly; for years and years Simon took him
along, so he learned the different places, and now
he does very well all by himself. He has often
taken travellers, and we have always been complimented
about him. As for intelligence, don't be
afraid&mdash;he has as much as you or I. He needs
only speech, but speech isn't required. If it was
to show a monument, now&mdash;why, yes, for then it
would be necessary to give some account and know
the historical dates; but here there are only the
beauties of nature. Take Blacky, and it will be
cheaper also; my husband would cost three francs,
whereas Blacky is only thirty sous, and he will
show you as much for thirty sous as my husband
would for three francs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well; and where is Blacky?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is resting in the sun, in the garden. Already
this morning he has taken some English
people to the Caldron. Shall I call him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, call him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Blacky! Blacky!&quot;</p>

<p>He came with a leap through the window. He
was a rather ugly-looking little dog, with long frizzy
hair, all mussed; he wasn't much to look at, but he
had, however, about him a certain air of gravity,
resolution, and importance. His first glance was
at me&mdash;a clear, searching, confident look that took
me in from head to toe, and that seemed to say,
&quot;It's a traveller, and he wants to see the Caldron.&quot;</p>

<p>One train missed sufficed me for that day, and I
was particularly anxious not to lay myself open to
another such experience, so I explained to the
good woman that I had only three hours for my
visit to the Caldron.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know,&quot; she said; &quot;you wish to take the
four-o'clock train. Don't be alarmed; Blacky will
bring you back in time. Now then, Blacky, off
with you; hurry up!&quot;</p>

<p>But Blacky didn't seem at all disposed to mind.
He stayed there motionless, looking at his mistress
with a certain uneasiness.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, how stupid of me!&quot; said the old woman.
&quot;I forgot the sugar;&quot; and she went to get four
pieces of sugar from a drawer, and gave them to
me, saying: &quot;That's why he wouldn't start; you
had no sugar. You see, Blacky, the gentleman
has the sugar. Now then, run along with you,
sir, to the Caldron! to the Caldron! to the Caldron!&quot;</p>

<p>She repeated these last words three times, slowly
and distinctly, and during that time I was closely
examining Blacky. He acknowledged the words
of his mistress with little movements of the head,
which rapidly became more emphatic, and towards
the end he evinced some temper and impatience.
They could be interpreted thus: &quot;Yes, yes, to the
Caldron&mdash;I understand. The gentleman has the
pieces of sugar, and we are going to the Caldron&mdash;it's
settled. Do you take me for a fool?&quot;</p>

<p>And, without waiting for Mme. Simon's third
&quot;To the Caldron!&quot; Blacky, evidently hurt, turned
tail, came and placed himself in front of me, and
by his look showed me the door, which told me as
plainly as a dog can tell, &quot;Now then, come along,
you!&quot;</p>

<p>I meekly followed him. We two started, he in
front, I behind. In this manner we went through
the entire village. The children who were playing
in the street recognized my guide.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, Blacky! good-morning, Blacky!&quot; They
wanted to play with the dog, but he turned his
head with a disdainful air&mdash;the air of a dog who
hasn't the time to answer himself, and who is
doing his duty and earning thirty sous. One of
the children exclaimed:</p>

<p>&quot;Leave him alone; don't you see he is taking
the gentleman to the Caldron? Good-day, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>And all repeated, laughing, &quot;Good-day, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>I smiled rather awkwardly; I am sure I felt
embarrassed, even a little humiliated. I was, in fact,
under the lead of that animal. He, for the present,
was my master. He knew where he was going;
I did not. I was in a hurry to get out of the village
and find myself alone with Blacky and face to
face with the beauties of nature that he had been
commissioned to show me.</p>

<p>These beauties of nature were, at the beginning,
a fearfully hot and dusty road, on which the sun
fell with full force. The dog walked with a brisk
step, and I was getting tired following him. I
tried to slacken his gait. &quot;Come, I say, Blacky,
my friend, not so quickly.&quot; But Blacky turned a
deaf ear, and continued, without listening to me,
his little trot. He was taken suddenly with a real
fit of anger when I wished to sit down in the corner
of a field, under a tree that gave a meagre
shade. He barked furiously, and cast on me outraged
looks; evidently what I was doing was
against the rule. He was not in the habit of
stopping there, and his barks were so piercing
and annoying that I rose to continue on my way.
Blacky became calm at once, and walked placidly
in front of me&mdash;I had understood him, and he was
satisfied.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards we entered a delightful path,
in full blossom, shady, sweet-smelling, and filled
with freshness and the murmur of springs. Blacky
immediately entered the wood, took to his heels,
and disappeared in the little footway. I followed,
slightly out of breath, and had not gone a hundred
steps when I found Blacky waiting for me, with
head erect and bright eyes, in a clearing enlivened
by the tinkle of a tiny cascade. There was there
an old rustic bench, and Blacky looked impatiently
from me to the seat and from the seat to me. I
was beginning to understand Blacky's language.</p>

<p>&quot;There now,&quot; he said to me, &quot;here is indeed a
place to rest in. It's nice and cool here; but you
were so stupid, you wanted to stop in the sun.
Come on, now; sit down; you really can sit down.
I will allow you.&quot;</p>

<p>I stopped, sat down, and lit a cigar, and came
near offering one to Blacky; perhaps he smoked.
But I thought he would prefer a piece of sugar.
He caught it on the fly very cleverly, and crunched
it with enjoyment. Then he lay down and took a
nap at my feet. He was evidently accustomed to
a little siesta at this place.</p>

<p>He slept barely ten minutes I was, however,
perfectly easy, for Blacky began to inspire me with
absolute confidence, and I was determined to obey
him blindly. He got up, stretched himself, and
threw me a glance that meant, &quot;Come along, my
friend, come along.&quot; And, like two old friends,
we set off slowly. Blacky was enjoying the silence
and the sweetness of the place. On the road, previously,
being in a hurry, he had walked with an
abrupt, sturdy, hurried step&mdash;he was walking to
get there; but now, refreshed and revived, Blacky
was walking for the pleasure of a promenade in one
of the prettiest paths in the Canton of Vaud.</p>

<p>Presently a side path appeared, leading off to the
left; there was a short hesitation on the part of
Blacky, who reflected, and then passed it, continuing
on his way straight ahead, but not without
some doubt and uncertainty in his manner. Then
he stopped; he must have made some mistake.
Yes; for he retraced his steps, and we took the
turning to the left, which, at the end of a hundred
feet, led into an open circular space, and Blacky,
with his nose in the air, invited me to contemplate
the highly respectable height of the lofty rocks
which formed this circle. When Blacky thought
I had seen sufficient, he turned around, and we
went on again in the path through the woods.
Blacky had forgotten to show me the circle of
rocks&mdash;a slight error quickly repaired.</p>

<p>The road soon became very mountainous, broken,
and difficult, and I advanced slowly and with many
precautions. As to Blacky, he sprang lightly from
rock to rock, but did not forsake me. He waited
and fixed his eyes on me with the most touching
solicitude. At last I began to hear a rushing of
water; Blacky commenced barking joyously.</p>

<p>&quot;Courage!&quot; he said to me; &quot;courage! We are
nearly there; you will soon see the Caldron.&quot;</p>

<p>It was in truth the Caldron. From a short
height a modest stream fell, splashing and rebounding
on a large rock slightly hollowed. I
should never have been consoled for such a steep
climb to see such a small sight if I had not had
brave little Blacky for a companion. He, at least,
was much more interesting and marvellous than the
Caldron. On either side of the fall, in little Swiss
chalets, were two dairy-maids; one was a blonde
and the other a brunette; both were in their national
dress, and were eagerly on the lookout for my coming,
standing on the door-steps of their tiny houses&mdash;little
wooden boxes, seemingly cut out by machine.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the blonde had very pretty
eyes, and I had already taken several steps towards
her when Blacky began to bark emphatically, and
resolutely barred the way. Could he have a preference
for the dark one? I walked in the other
direction. That was it; Blacky calmed down as
though by enchantment when he saw me seated
at a table in front of the house of his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e.
I asked for a cup of milk; Blacky's friend
entered her little toy house, and Blacky slipped in
at her feet. Through a half-open window I followed
him with my eyes. The wretch! He was
waited upon before I was. He it was who first
had his large bowl of milk. He had sold himself!
After which, with white drops on his mustache,
Blacky came to keep me company and look at me
drink my milk. I gave him a piece of sugar, and
both of us, absolutely satisfied with each other,
filled our lungs with the sharp air of the mountain.
We were at a height of about three or four hundred
yards. It was a delightful half-hour.</p>

<p>Blacky began to show signs of impatience and
agitation. I could read him then like a book. It
was time to go. I paid, got up, and while I went
off to the right towards the path by which we came
to the mountain, I saw Blacky go and plant himself
on the left, at the opening of another path. He
gave me a serious and severe look. What progress
I had made during the last two hours, and how
familiar Blacky's eloquent silence had become!</p>

<p>&quot;What must you think of me?&quot; said Blacky to
me. &quot;Do you imagine I am going to take the
same path twice? No, indeed. I am a good
guide, and I know my business. We shall make
the descent another way.&quot;</p>

<p>We went back by another road, which was much
prettier than the first. Blacky, quite sprightly,
often turned around to me with an air of triumphant
joy. We traversed the village, and at the station
Blacky was assailed by three or four dogs of
his acquaintance, who seemed desirous of a talk or
game with their comrade. They attempted to
block his way, but Blacky, grumbling and growling,
repulsed their advances.</p>

<p>&quot;Can't you see what I am doing? I am taking
this gentleman to the station.&quot;</p>

<p>It was only in the waiting-room that he consented
to leave me, after having eaten with relish
the two last pieces of sugar. And this is how I
interpreted the farewell look of Blacky:</p>

<p>&quot;We are twenty minutes ahead of time. It isn't
I who would have let you lose the train. Well,
good-bye&mdash;pleasant journey!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MOST_BEAUTIFUL_WOMAN_IN_PARIS" id="THE_MOST_BEAUTIFUL_WOMAN_IN_PARIS"></a>THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN PARIS</h2>


<p>On Friday, April 19th, Prince Ag&eacute;nor was really
distracted at the opera during the second act of
&quot;Sigurd.&quot; The prince kept going from box to box,
and his enthusiasm increased as he went.</p>

<p>&quot;That blonde! Oh, that blonde! She is ideal!
Look at that blonde! Do you know that blonde?&quot;</p>

<p>It was from the front part of Mme. de Marizy's
large first tier box that all these exclamations were
coming at that moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Which blonde?&quot; asked Mme. de Marizy.</p>

<p>&quot;Which blonde! Why, there is but one this
evening in the house. Opposite to you, over there,
in the first box, the Sainte Mesme's box. Look,
baroness, look straight over there&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes I am looking at her. She is atrociously
got up, but pretty&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty! She is a wonder! Simply a wonder!
Got up? Yes, agreed&mdash;some country relative. The
Sainte Mesmes have cousins in P&eacute;rigord. But what
a smile! How well her neck is set on! And the slope
of the shoulders! Ah, especially the shoulders!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come, either keep still or go away. Let me
listen to Mme. Caron&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The prince went away, as no one knew that incomparable
blonde. Yet she had often been to the
opera, but in an unpretentious way&mdash;in the second
tier of boxes. And to Prince Ag&eacute;nor above the
first tier of boxes there was nothing, absolutely
nothing. There was emptiness&mdash;space. The prince
had never been in a second-tier box, so the second-tier
boxes did not exist.</p>

<p>While Mme. Caron was marvellously singing the
marvellous phrase of Reyer, &quot;<i>&Ocirc; mon sauveur silencieux
la Valkyrie est ta conqu&ecirc;te</i>,&quot; the prince strolled
along the passages of the opera. Who was that
blonde? He wanted to know, and he would know.</p>

<p>And suddenly he remembered that good Mme.
Picard was the box-opener of the Sainte Mesmes,
and that he, Prince of N&eacute;rins, had had the honor of
being for a long time a friend of that good Mme.
Picard. It was she who in the last years of the
Second Empire had taught him bezique in all its
varieties&mdash;Japanese, Chinese, etc. He was then
twenty, Mme. Picard was forty. She was not then
box-opener of the National Academy of Music; she
had in those times as office&mdash;and it was not a
sinecure&mdash;the position of aunt to a nice young
person who showed a very pretty face and a very
pretty pair of legs in the chorus of the <i>revues</i> of
the Vari&eacute;t&eacute;e. And the prince, while quite young,
at the beginning of his life, had, for three or four
years, led a peaceful, almost domestic life, with the
aunt and niece. Then they went off one way and
he another.</p>

<p>One evening at the opera, ten years later, in
handing his overcoat to a venerable-looking old
dame, Ag&eacute;nor heard himself saluted by the following
little speech:</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, how happy I am to see you again, prince!
And not changed&mdash;not at all changed. Still the
same, absolutely the same&mdash;still twenty.&quot;</p>

<p>It was Mme. Picard, who had been raised to the
dignity of box-opener. They chatted, talked of
old times, and after that evening the prince never
passed Mme. Picard without greeting her. She
responded with a little deferential courtesy. She
was one of those people, becoming rarer and rarer
nowadays, who have the exact feeling for distances
and conventions. There was, however, a little remnant
of familiarity, almost of affection, in the way
in which she said &quot;prince.&quot; This did not displease
Ag&eacute;nor; he had a very good recollection of Mme.
Picard.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, prince,&quot; said Mme. Picard on seeing Ag&eacute;nor,
&quot;there is no one for you to-night in <i>my</i> boxes.
Mme. de Simiane is not here, and Mme. de Sainte
Mesme has rented her box.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's precisely it. Don't you know the people
in Mme. de Sainte Mesme's box?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all, prince. It's the first time I have
seen them in the marquise's box&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you have no idea&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None, prince. Only to me they don't appear
to be people of&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She was going to say of <i>our</i> set. A box-opener
of the first tier of boxes at the opera, having generally
only to do with absolutely high-born people,
considers herself as being a little of their set, and
shows extreme disdain for unimportant people; it
displeases her to receive these unimportant people
in <i>her</i> boxes. Mme. Picard, however, had tact
which rarely forsook her, and so stopped herself in
time to say:</p>

<p>&quot;People of <i>your</i> set. They belong to the middle
class, to the wealthy middle class; but still the middle
class. That doesn't satisfy you; you wish to
know more on account of the blonde. Is it not so,
prince?&quot;</p>

<p>Those last words were spoken with rare delicacy;
they were murmured more than spoken&mdash;box-opener
to a prince! It would have been unacceptable without
that perfect reserve in accent and tone; yes, it
was a box-opener who spoke, but a box-opener who
was a little bit the aunt of former times, the aunt
<i>&agrave; la mode de Cyth&egrave;re</i>. Mme. Picard continued:</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, she is a beauty! She came with a little
dark man&mdash;her husband, I'm sure; for while she
was taking off her cloak&mdash;it always takes some
time&mdash;he didn't say a word to her. No eagerness,
no little attentions. Yes, he could only be a husband.
I examined the cloak. People one doesn't
know puzzle me and <i>my</i> colleague. Mme. Flachet
and I always amuse ourselves by trying to guess
from appearances. Well, the cloak comes from a
good dress-maker, but not from a great one. It is
fine and well-made, but it has no style. I think
they are middle-class people, prince. But how
stupid I am! You know M. Palmer&mdash;well, a little
while ago he came to see the beautiful blonde!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;M. Palmer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and he can tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, Mme. Picard, thanks&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye, prince, good-bye,&quot; and Mme. Picard
went back to her stool, near her colleague, Mme.
Flachet, and said to her:</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my dear, what a charming man the prince
is! True gentlefolks, there is nothing like them!
But they are dying out, they are dying out; there
are many less than formerly.&quot;</p>

<p>Prince Ag&eacute;nor was willing to do Palmer&mdash;big Palmer,
rich Palmer, vain Palmer&mdash;the honor of being
one of his friends; he deigned, and very frequently,
to confide to Palmer his financial difficulties,
and the banker was delighted to come to his aid.
The prince had been obliged to resign himself to
becoming a member of two boards of directors
presided over by Palmer, who was much pleased at
having under obligations to him the representative
of one of the noblest families in France. Besides,
the prince proved himself to be a <i>good prince</i>, and
publicly acknowledged Palmer, showing himself in
his box, taking charge of his entertainments, and
occupying himself with his racing-stable. He had
even pushed his gratitude to the point of compromising
Mme. Palmer in the most showy way.</p>

<p>&quot;I am removing her from the middle class,&quot; he
said; &quot;I owe it to Palmer, who is one of the best
fellows in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>The prince found the banker alone in a lower
box.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the name&mdash;the name of that blonde in
the Sainte Mesme's box?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mme. Derline.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is there a M. Derline?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly, a lawyer&mdash;my lawyer; the Sainte
Mesme's lawyer. And if you want to see Mme.
Derline close to, come to my ball next Thursday.
She will be there&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The wife of a lawyer!. She was only the wife of
a lawyer! The prince sat down in the front of the
box, opposite Mme. Derline, and while looking
at that lawyeress he was thinking. &quot;Have I,&quot; he
said to himself, &quot;sufficient credit, sufficient power,
to make of Mme. Derline the most beautiful woman
in Paris?&quot;</p>

<p>For there was always a <i>most beautiful woman in
Paris</i>, and it was he, Prince Ag&eacute;nor, who flattered
himself that he could discover, proclaim, crown,
and consecrate that most beautiful woman in Paris.
Launch Mme. Derline in society! Why not? He
had never launched any one from the middle class.
The enterprise would be new, amusing, and bold.
He looked at Mme. Derline through his opera-glass,
and discovered thousands of beauties and
perfections in her delightful face.</p>

<p>After the opera, the prince, during the exit,
placed himself at the bottom of the great staircase.
He had enlisted two of his friends. &quot;Come,&quot; he
had said to them, &quot;I will show you the most beautiful
woman in Paris.&quot; While he was speaking,
two steps away from the prince was an alert young
man who was attached to a morning paper, a very
widely-read paper. The young man had sharp
ears, he caught on the fly the phrase of the Prince
Ag&eacute;nor, whose high social position he knew; he
succeeded in keeping close to the prince, and when
Mme. Derline passed, the young reporter had the
gift of hearing the conversation, without losing
a word, of the three brilliant noblemen. A quarter
of an hour later he arrived at the office of the
paper.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there time,&quot; he asked, &quot;to write a dozen lines
in the <i>Society Note-book</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but hurry.&quot;</p>

<p>The young man was a quick writer; the fifteen
lines were done in the twinkling of an eye. They
brought seven francs fifty to the reporter, but cost
M. Derline a little more than that.</p>

<p>During this time Prince Ag&eacute;nor, seated in the
club at the whist-table, was saying, while shuffling
the cards:</p>

<p>&quot;This evening at the opera there was a marvellous
woman, a certain Mme. Derline. She is the
most beautiful woman in Paris!&quot;</p>

<p>The following morning, in the gossip-corner of
the Bois, in the spring sunshine, the prince, surrounded
by a little group of respectful disciples,
was solemnly delivering from the back of his roan
mare the following opinion:</p>

<p>&quot;Listen well to what I say. The most beautiful
woman in Paris is a certain Mme. Derline. This
star will be visible Thursday evening at the Palmer's.
Go, and don't forget the name&mdash;Mme.
Derline.&quot;</p>

<p>The disciples dispersed, and went abroad spreading
the great news.</p>

<p>Mme. Derline had been admirably brought up
by an irreproachable mother; she had been taught
that she ought to get up in the morning, keep a
strict account of her expenses, not go to a great
dress-maker, believe in God, love her husband, visit
the poor, and never spend but half her income in
order to prepare dowries for her daughters. Mme.
Derline performed all these duties. She led a
peaceful and serene life in the old house (in the
Rue Dragon) which had sheltered, since 1825, three
generations of Derlines; the husbands had all three
been lawyers, the wives had all three been virtuous.
The three generations had passed there a happy
and moderate life, never having any great pleasures,
but, also, never being very bored.</p>

<p>The next day at eight o'clock in the morning
Mme. Derline awoke with an uneasy feeling. She
had passed a troubled night&mdash;she, who usually slept
like a child. The evening before at the opera, in
the box, Mme. Derline had vaguely felt that something
was going on around her. And during the
entire last act an opera-glass, obstinately fixed on
her&mdash;the prince's opera-glass&mdash;had thrown her
into a certain agitation, not disagreeable, however.
She wore a low dress&mdash;too much so, in her mother's
opinion&mdash;and two or three times, under the fixity
of that opera-glass, she had raised the shoulder-straps
of her dress.</p>

<p>So, after opening her eyes, Mme. Derline reclosed
them lazily, indolently, with thoughts floating
between dreamland and reality. She again
saw the opera-house, and a hundred, two hundred,
five hundred opera-glasses obstinately fixed on her&mdash;on
her alone.</p>

<p>The maid entered, placed a tray on a little table,
made up a big fire in the fire-place, and went away.
There was a cup of chocolate and the morning paper
on the tray, the same as every morning. Then Mme.
Derline courageously got up, slipped her little
bare feet into fur slippers, wrapped herself in a
white cashmere dressing-gown, and crouched shivering
in an arm-chair by the fire. She sipped the
chocolate, and slightly burned herself; she must
wait a little while. She put down the cup, took up
the paper, unfolded it, and rapidly ran her eye
over the six columns of the front page. At the
bottom, quite at the bottom of the sixth column,
were the following lines:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Last evening at the opera there was a very brilliant
performance of &quot;Sigurd.&quot; Society was well represented
there; the beautiful Duchess of Montaiglon, the
pretty Countess Verdini&egrave;re of Lardac, the marvellous
Marquise of Muriel, the lively Baroness of</i>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>To read the name of the baroness it was necessary
to turn the page. Mme. Derline did not turn
it; she was thinking, reflecting. The evening before
she had amused herself by having Palmer point out
to her the social leaders in the house, and it so
happened that the banker had pointed out to her
the marvellous marquise. And Mme. Derline&mdash;who
was twenty-two&mdash;raised herself a little to look in the
glass. She exchanged a slight smile with a young
blonde, who was very pink and white.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;if I were a marquise
the man who wrote this would perhaps have paid
some attention to me, and my name would perhaps
be there. I wonder if it's fun to see one's name
printed in a paper?&quot;</p>

<p>And while addressing this question to herself, she
turned the page, and continued reading:</p>

<blockquote><p>&mdash;<i>the lively Baroness of Myrvoix, etc. We have
to announce the appearance of a new star which has
abruptly burst forth in the Parisian constellation.
The house was in ecstasy over a strange and disturbing
blonde, whose dark steel eyes, and whose shoulders&mdash;ah,
what shoulders! The shoulders were the event
of the evening. From all quarters one heard asked,
&quot;Who is she?&quot; &quot;Who is she?&quot; &quot;To whom do
those divine shoulders belong?&quot; &quot;To whom?&quot; We
know, and our readers will doubtless thank us for telling
them the name of this ideal wonder. It is Mme.
Derline.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Her name! She had read her name! She was
dazzled. Her eyes clouded. All the letters in
the alphabet began to dance wildly on the paper.
Then they calmed down, stopped, and regained
their places. She was able to find her name, and
continue reading;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>It is Mme. Derline, the wife of one of the most
agreeable and richest lawyers in Paris. The Prince
of N&eacute;rins, whose word has so much weight in such
matters, said yesterday evening to every one who would
listen, &quot;She is the most beautiful woman in Paris.&quot;
We are absolutely of that opinion.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>A single paragraph, and that was all. It was
enough, it was too much! Mme Derline was seized
with a feeling of undefinable confusion. It was
a combination of fear and pleasure, of joy and
trouble, of satisfied vanity and wounded modesty.
Her dressing-gown was a little open; she folded it
over with a sort of violence, and crossed it upon,
her feet, abruptly drawn back towards the arm-chair.
She had a feeling of nudity. It seemed to
her that all Paris was there, in her room, and that
the Prince de N&eacute;rins was in front saying to all Paris,
&quot;Look, look! She is the most beautiful woman in
Paris.&quot;</p>

<p>The Prince of N&eacute;rins! She knew the name
well, for she read with keen interest in the papers
all the articles entitled &quot;<i>Parisian Life</i>,&quot; &quot;<i>High
Life</i>,&quot; &quot;<i>Society Echoes</i>,&quot; etc.; and all the society
columns signed &quot;<i>Mousseline</i>,&quot; &quot;<i>Fanfreluche</i>,&quot; &quot;<i>Brimborion</i>,&quot;
&quot;<i>V&eacute;loutine</i>&quot;; all the accounts of great marriages,
great balls, of great comings out, and of
great charity sales. The name of the prince often
figured in these articles, and he was always quoted
as supreme arbiter of Parisian elegances.</p>

<p>And it was he who had declared&mdash;ah!&mdash;decidedly
pleasure got the better of fear. Still trembling with
emotion, Mme. Derline went and placed herself
before a long looking-glass, an old cheval-glass
from Jacob's, which never till now had reflected
other than good middle-class women married to
good lawyers. In that glass she looked at herself,
examined herself, studied herself, long, curiously,
and eagerly. Of course she knew she was pretty,
but oh, the power of print! She found herself absolutely
delightful. She was no longer Mme.
Derline&mdash;she was the most beautiful woman in Paris!
Her feet, her little feet&mdash;their bareness no longer
troubled her&mdash;left the ground. She raised herself
gently towards the heavens, towards the clouds, and
felt herself become a goddess.</p>

<p>But suddenly an anxiety seized her. &quot;Edward!
What would Edward say?&quot; Edward was her husband.
There had been but one man's surname in
her life&mdash;her husband's. The lawyer was well loved!
And almost at the same moment when she was asking
herself what Edward would say, Edward abruptly
opened the door.</p>

<p>He was a little out of breath. He had run up-stairs
two at a time. He was peacefully rummaging
among old papers in his study on the ground-floor
when one of his brother-lawyers, with forced congratulations,
however, had made him read the famous
article. He had soon got rid of his brother-lawyer,
and he had come, much irritated, to his
room. At first there was simply a torrent of words.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do these journalists meddle? It's an outrage!
Your name&mdash;look, there is your name in this
paper!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know, I've seen&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, you know, you have seen&mdash;and you think
it quite natural!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, dear&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What times do we live in? It's your fault, too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My fault!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, your fault!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your dress last night was too low, much too
low. Besides, your mother told you so&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, mamma&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You needn't say 'Oh, mamma!' Your mother
was right. There, read: 'And whose shoulders&mdash;ah,
what shoulders!' And it is of your shoulders
they are speaking. And that prince who dares to
award you a prize for beauty!&quot;</p>

<p>The good man had plebeian, Gothical ideas&mdash;the
ideas of a lawyer of old times, of a lawyer of the
Rue Dragon; the lawyers of the Boulevard Malesherbes
are no longer like that.</p>

<p>Mme. Derline very gently, very quietly, brought
the rebel back to reason. Of course there was charm
and eloquence in her speech, but how much more
charm and eloquence in the tenderness of her
glance and smile.</p>

<p>Why this great rage and despair? He was accused
of being the husband of the most beautiful
woman in Paris. Was that such a horrible thing,
such a terrible misfortune? And who was the
brother-lawyer, the good brother-lawyer, who had
taken pleasure in coming to show him the hateful
article?</p>

<p>&quot;M. Renaud.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it was M. Renaud&mdash;dear M. Renaud!&quot;</p>

<p>Thereupon Mme. Derline was seized with a
hearty fit of laughter; so much so that the blond
hair, which had been loosely done up, came down
and framed the pretty face from which gleamed the
dark eyes which could also, when they gave themselves
the trouble, look very gentle, very caressing,
very loving.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it was M. Renaud, the husband of that
delightful Mme. Renaud! Well, do you know what
you will do immediately, without losing a minute?
Go to the president of the Tribunal and ask for
a divorce. You will say to him: 'M. Aub&eacute;pin, deliver
me from my wife. Her crime is being pretty,
very pretty, too pretty. I wish another one who
is ugly, very ugly, who has Mme. Renaud's large
nose, colossal foot, pointed chin, skinny shoulders,
and eternal pimples.' That's what you want, isn't
it? Come, you big stupid, kiss your poor wife, and
forgive her for not being a monster.&quot;</p>

<p>As rather lively gestures had illustrated this little
speech, the white cashmere dressing-gown had
slipped&mdash;slipped a good deal, and had opened, very
much opened; the criminal shoulders were within
reach of M. Derline's lips&mdash;he succumbed. Besides,
he too felt the abominable influence of the
press. His wife had never seemed so pretty to
him, and, brought back to subjection, M. Derline
returned to his study in order to make money for
the most beautiful woman in Paris.</p>

<p>A very wise and opportune occupation; for scarcely
was Mme. Derline left alone when an idea
flashed through her head which was to call forth
a very pretty collection of bank-notes from the cash-box
of the lawyer of the Rue Dragon. Mme.
Derline had intended wearing to the Palmer's ball
a dress which had already been much seen. Mme.
Derline had kept the dress-maker of her wedding-dress,
her mother's dress-maker, a dress-maker
of the Left Bank. It seemed to her that her new
position imposed new duties on her. She could
not appear at the Palmer's without a dress which
had not been seen, and stamped with a well-known
name. She ordered the carriage in the afternoon,
and resolutely gave her coachman the address of
one of the most illustrious dress-makers in Paris.
She arrived a little agitated, and to reach the great
artist was obliged to pass through a veritable crowd
of footmen, who were in the antechamber chatting
and laughing, used to meeting there and making
long stops. Nearly all the footmen were those of
society, the highest society; they had spent the
previous evening together at the English Embassy,
and were to be that evening at the Duchess of Gr&eacute;moille.</p>

<p>Mme. Derline entered a sumptuous parlor; it
was very sumptuous, too sumptuous. Twenty great
customers were there&mdash;society women and actresses,
all agitated, anxious, feverish&mdash;looking at the beautiful
tall saleswomen come and go before them,
wearing the last creations of the master of the
house. The great artist had a diplomatic bearing:
buttoned-up black frock-coat, long cravat with pin
(a present from a royal highness who paid her
bills slowly), and a many-colored rosette in his
button-hole (the gift of a small reigning prince
who paid slower yet the bills of an opera-dancer).
He came and went&mdash;precise, calm, and cool&mdash;in
the midst of the solicitations and supplications of
his customers. &quot;M. Arthur! M. Arthur!&quot; One
heard nothing but that phrase. He was M. Arthur.
He went from one to the other&mdash;respectful, without
too much humility, to the duchesses, and easy,
without too much familiarity, to the actresses.
There was an extraordinary liveliness, and a confusion
of marvellous velvets, satins, and embroidered,
brocaded, and gold or silver threaded stuffs,
all thrown here and there, as though by accident&mdash;but
what science in that accident&mdash;on arm-chairs,
tables, and divans.</p>

<p>In the first place Mme. Derline ran against a
shop-girl who was bearing with outstretched arms
a white dress, and was almost hidden beneath a
light mountain of muslins and laces. The only
thing visible was the shop-girl's mussed black
hair and sly suburban expression. Mme. Derline
backed away, wishing to place herself against the,
wall; but a tryer-on was there, a large energetic brunette,
who spoke authoritatively in a high staccato.
&quot;At once,&quot; she was saying&mdash;&quot;bring me at once
the princess's dress!&quot;</p>

<p>Frightened and dazed, Mme. Derline stood in
a corner and watched an opportunity to seize a
saleswoman on the fly. She even thought of giving
up the game. Never, certainly, should she
dare to address directly that terrible M. Arthur,
who had just given her a rapid glance in which
she believed to have read, &quot;Who is she? She
isn't properly dressed! She doesn't go to a fashionable
dress-maker!&quot; At last Mme. Derline
succeeded in getting hold of a disengaged saleswoman,
and there was the same slightly disdainful
glance&mdash;a glance which was accompanied by the
phrase:</p>

<p>&quot;Madame is not a regular customer of the
house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I am not a customer&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you wish?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A dress, a ball-dress&mdash;and I want the dress
for next Thursday evening&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thursday next!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Thursday next.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! madame, it is not to be thought of.
Even for a customer of the house it would be impossible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I wished it so much&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go and see M. Arthur. He alone can&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And where is M. Arthur?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In his office. He has just gone into his office.
Over there, madame, opposite.&quot;</p>

<p>Mme. Derline, through a half-open door, saw a
sombre and severe but luxurious room&mdash;an ambassador's
office. On the walls the great European
powers were represented by photographs&mdash;the
Empress Eug&eacute;nie, the Princess of Wales, a
grand-duchess of Russia, and an archduchess
of Austria. M. Arthur was there taking a few
moments' rest, seated in a large arm-chair, with
an air of lassitude and exhaustion, and with a
newspaper spread out over his knees. He arose
on seeing Mme. Derline enter. In a trembling
voice she repeated her wish.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, madame, a ball-dress&mdash;a beautiful ball-dress&mdash;for
Thursday! I couldn't make such a promise&mdash;I
couldn't keep it. There are responsibilities
to which I never expose myself.&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke slowly, gravely, as a man conscious
of his high position.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I am so disappointed. It was a particular
occasion and I was told that you alone
could&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Two tears, two little tears, glittered on her eye-lashes.
M. Arthur was moved. A woman, a
pretty woman, crying there, before him! Never
had such homage been paid to his genius.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, madame, I am willing to make an attempt.
A very simple dress&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, not simple. Very brilliant, on the contrary&mdash;everything
that is most brilliant. Two of
my friends are customers of yours (she named
them), and I am Mme. Derline&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mme. Derline! You are Mme. Derline?&quot;</p>

<p>The two <i>Mme. Derlines</i> were followed by a
glance and a smile&mdash;the glance was at the newspaper
and the smile was at Mme. Derline; but it
was a discreet, self-contained smile&mdash;the smile of
a perfectly gallant man. This is what the glance
and smile said with admirable clearness:</p>

<p>&quot;Ah I you are Mme. Derline&mdash;that already celebrated
Mme. Derline&mdash;who yesterday at the opera&mdash;I
understand, I understand&mdash;I was reading just
now in this paper&mdash;words are no longer necessary&mdash;you
should have told your name at once&mdash;yes,
you need me; yes, you shall have your dress;
yes, I want to divide your success with you.&quot;</p>

<p>M. Arthur called:</p>

<p>&quot;Mademoiselle Blanche, come here at once!
Mademoiselle Blanche!&quot;</p>

<p>And turning towards Mme. Derline, he said:</p>

<p>&quot;She has great talent, but I shall myself superintend
it; so be easy&mdash;yes, I myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Mme. Derline was a little confused, a little embarrassed
by her glory, but happy nevertheless.
Mademoiselle Blanche came forward.</p>

<p>&quot;Conduct madame,&quot; said M. Arthur, &quot;and
take the necessary measures for a ball-dress,
very low, and with absolutely bare arms. During
that time, madame, I am going to think seriously
of what I can do for you. It must be something
entirely new&mdash;ah! before going, permit me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He walked very slowly around Mme. Derline,
and examined her with profound attention; then
he walked away, and considered her from a little
distance. His face was serious, thoughtful, and
anxious. A great thinker wrestling with a great
problem. He passed his hand over his forehead,
raised his eyes to the sky, getting inspiration by
a painful delivery; but suddenly his face lit up&mdash;the
spirit from above had answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Go, madame,&quot; he said, &quot;go. Your dress is
thought out. When you come back, mademoiselle,
bring me that piece of pink satin; you know, the
one that I was keeping for some great occasion.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus Mme. Derline found herself with Mademoiselle
Blanche in a trying-on room, which was
a sort of little cabin lined with mirrors. A quarter
of an hour later, when the measures had been taken,
Mme. Derline came back and discovered M. Arthur
in the midst of pieces of satin of all colors, of
cr&ecirc;pes, of tulles, of laces, and of brocaded stuffs.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, not the pink satin,&quot; he said to Mademoiselle
Blanche, who was bringing the asked-for
piece; &quot;no, I have found something better.
Listen to me. This is what I wish: I have
given up the pink, and I have decided on this, this
peach-colored satin. A classic robe, outlining all
the fine lines and showing the suppleness of the
body. This robe must be very clinging&mdash;hardly
any underskirts. It must be of surah. Madame
must be melted into it&mdash;do you thoroughly understand?&mdash;absolutely
melted into the robe. We will
drop over the dress this cr&ecirc;pe&mdash;yes, that one, but
in small, light pleats. The cr&ecirc;pe will be as a cloud
thrown over the dress&mdash;a transparent, vapory, impalpable
cloud. The arms are to be absolutely
bare, as I already told you. On each shoulder
there must be a simple knot, showing the upper
part of the arm. Of what is the knot to be? I'm
still undecided&mdash;I need to think it over&mdash;till to-morrow,
madame, till to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Mme. Derline came back the next day, and the
next, and every day till the day before the famous
Thursday; and each time that she came back,
while awaiting her turn to try on, she ordered
dresses, very simple ones, but yet costing from
seven to eight hundred francs each.</p>

<p>And that was not all. On the day of her first
visit to M. Arthur, when Mme. Derline came out
of the great house, she was broken-hearted&mdash;positively
broken-hearted&mdash;at the sight of her brougham;
it really did make a pitiful appearance among
all the stylish carriages which were waiting in three
rows and taking up half the street. It was the
brougham of her late mother-in-law, and it still
rolled through the streets of Paris after fifteen
years' service. Mme. Derline got into the woe-begone
brougham to drive straight to a very well-known
carriage-maker, and that evening, cleverly
seizing the psychological moment, she explained
to M. Derline that she had seen a certain little
black coup&eacute; lined with blue satin that would frame
delightfully her new dresses.</p>

<p>The coup&eacute; was bought the next day by M.
Derline, who also was beginning fully to realize
the extent of his new duties. But the next day it
was discovered that it was impossible to harness
to that jewel of a coup&eacute; the old horse who had
pulled the old carriage, and no less impossible to
put on the box the old coachman who drove the
old horse.</p>

<p>This is how on Thursday, April 25th, at half-past
ten in the evening, a very pretty chestnut
mare, driven by a very correct English coachman,
took M. and Mme. Derline to the Palmer's. They
still lacked something&mdash;a little groom to sit beside
the English coachman. But a certain amount of
discretion had to be employed. The most beautiful
woman in Paris intended to wait ten days before
asking for the little groom.</p>

<p>While she was going up-stairs at the Palmer's,
she distinctly felt her heart beat like the strokes of
a hammer. She was going to play a decisive game.
She knew that the Palmers had been going everywhere,
saying, &quot;Come on Thursday; we will show
you Mme. Derline, the most beautiful woman in
Paris.&quot; Curiosity as well as jealousy had been
well awakened.</p>

<p>She entered, and from the first minute she had
the delicious sensation of her success. Throughout
the long gallery of the Palmer's house it was a
true triumphal march. She advanced with firm
and precise step, erect, and head well held. She
appeared to see nothing, to hear nothing, but how
well she saw! how well she felt, the fire of all those
eyes on her shoulders! Around her arose a little
murmur of admiration, and never had music been
sweeter to her.</p>

<p>Yes, decidedly, all went well. She was on a fair
way to conquer Paris. And, sure of herself, at
each step she became more confident, lighter, and
bolder, as she advanced on Palmer's arm, who, in
passing, pointed out the counts, the marquises, and
the dukes. And then Palmer suddenly said to her:</p>

<p>&quot;I want to present to you one of your greatest
admirers, who, the other night at the opera, spoke
of nothing but your beauty; he is the Prince of
N&eacute;rins.&quot;</p>

<p>She became as red as a cherry. Palmer looked
at her and began to laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, you read the other day in that paper?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I read&mdash;yes, I read&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But where is the prince, where is he? I saw
him during the day, and he was to be here early.&quot;</p>

<p>Mme. Derline was not to see the Prince of
N&eacute;rins that evening. And yet he had intended to
go to the Palmers and preside at the deification of
his lawyeress. He had dined at the club, and had
allowed himself to be dragged off to a first performance
at a minor theatre. An operetta of the
regulation type was being played. The principal
personage was a young queen, who was always
escorted by the customary four maids-of-honor.</p>

<p>Three of these young ladies were very well
known to first-nighters, as having already figured
in the tableaux of operettas and in groups of
fairies, but the fourth&mdash;Oh, the fourth! She was
a new one, a tall brunette of the most striking
beauty. The prince made himself remarked more
than all others by his enthusiasm. He completely
forgot that he was to leave after the first act. The
play was over very late, and the prince was still
there, having paid no attention to the piece or the
music, having seen nothing but the wonderful
brunette, having heard nothing but the stanza
which she had unworthily massacred in the middle
of the second act. And while they were leaving
the theatre, the prince was saying to whoever
would listen:</p>

<p>&quot;That brunette! oh, that brunette! She hasn't
an equal in any theatre! She is the most beautiful
woman in Paris! The most beautiful!&quot;</p>

<p>It was one o'clock in the morning. The prince
asked himself if he should go to the Palmers.
Poor Mme. Derline; she was of very slight importance
beside this new wonder! And then, too,
the prince was a methodical man. The hour for
whist had arrived; so he departed to play whist.</p>

<p>The following morning Mme. Derline found ten
lines on the Palmer's ball in the &quot;society column.&quot;
There was mention of the marquises, the
countesses, and the duchesses who were there, but
about Mme. Derline there was not a word&mdash;not a
word.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the writer of theatrical gossip
celebrated in enthusiastic terms the beauty of that
ideal maid-of-honor, and said, &quot;<i>Besides, the Prince
of N&eacute;rins declared that Mademoiselle Miranda was
indisputedly the most beautiful woman in Paris!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Mme. Derline threw the paper in the fire. She
did not wish her husband to know that she was
already not the most beautiful woman in Paris.</p>

<p>She has, however, kept the great dress-maker
and the English coachman, but she never dared to
ask for the little groom.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_A_BALL_DRESS" id="THE_STORY_OF_A_BALL_DRESS"></a>THE STORY OF A BALL-DRESS</h2>


<p>When the women of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries write their memoirs they boldly
present themselves to the reader thus: &quot;I have a
well-shaped mouth,&quot; said the Marquise of Courcelles,
&quot;beautiful lips, pearly teeth, good forehead,
cheeks, and expression, finely chiselled throat, divine
hands, passable arms (that is to say, they are
a little thin); but I find consolation for that misfortune
in the fact that I have the prettiest legs in
the world.&quot;</p>

<p>And I will follow the marquise's example. Here
is my portrait: Overskirt of white illusion trimmed
with fringe, and three flounces of blond alternating
with the fringe; court mantle of cherry silk
girt by a high flounce of white blond which falls
over the fringe and is caught up by Marie Antoinette
satin; two other flounces of blond are
placed behind at intervals above; on each side
from the waist up are facings composed of little
alternating flounces of blond, looped up with satin;
the big puff behind is bound by a flounce of white
blond. A little white waist, the front and shoulder-straps
of which are of satin trimmed with blond.
Belt of red satin with large red butterfly.</p>

<p>The world was made in six days, I in three. And
yet I too am in the world&mdash;a little complicated world
of silk, satin, blond, loops, and fringes. Did God
rest while he was making the world? I do not
know; but I do know that the scissors that cut
me out and the needle that sewed me rested neither
day nor night from Monday evening, January
24, 1870, to Thursday morning, January 27th. The
slashes of the scissors and the pricks of the needle
caused me great pain at first, but I soon paid no
attention to them at all. I began to observe what
was going on, to understand that I was becoming
a dress, and to discover that the dress would be a
marvel. From time to time M. Worth came himself
to pay me little visits. &quot;Take in the waist,&quot;
he would say, &quot;add more fringe, spread out the
train, enlarge the butterfly,&quot; etc.</p>

<p>One thing worried me: For whom was I intended?
I knew the name, nothing more&mdash;the Baroness
Z&mdash;&mdash;. Princess would have been better; but
still, baroness did very well. I was ambitious. I
dreaded the theatre. It remained to be seen whether
this baroness was young, pretty, and equal to
wearing me boldly, and whether she had a figure
to show me off to advantage. I was horribly afraid
of falling into the hands of an ugly woman, a provincial,
or an old coquette.</p>

<p>How perfectly reassured I was as soon as I saw
the baroness! Small, delicate, supple, stylish, a
fairy waist, the shoulders of a goddess, and, besides
all this, a certain little air of audacity, of raillery,
but in exquisite moderation.</p>

<p>I was spread out on a large pearl-gray lounge,
and I was received with marks of frank admiration.
M. Worth had been good enough to bring me <i>himself</i>,
and he didn't trouble himself about all dresses.</p>

<p>&quot;How original!&quot; exclaimed the little baroness;
&quot;how new! But very dear, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One thousand and fifty francs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One thousand and fifty francs! And I furnished
the lace! Ah, how quickly I should leave
you if I didn't owe you so much! For I owe you
a lot of money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, very little, baroness&mdash;very little.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no; a great deal. But we will discuss that
another day.&quot;</p>

<p>That evening I made my first appearance in society,
and I came out at the Tuileries. We both
of us, the baroness and myself, had an undeniable
success. When the Empress crossed the Salon of
Diana, making pleasant remarks to the right and
left, she had the graciousness to stop before us and
make the following remark, which seemed to me
extremely witty, &quot;Ah, baroness, what a dress&mdash;what
a dress! It's a dream!&quot; On that occasion
the Empress wore a dress of white tulle dotted with
silver, on a design of cloudy green, with epaulettes
of sable. It was queer, not ineffective, but in
doubtful taste.</p>

<p>We received much attention, the baroness and I.
The new Minister, M. &Eacute;mile Ollivier, was presented
to us; we received him coldly, as the little baroness
did not approve, I believe, of liberal reforms,
and looked for nothing good from them. We had
a long chat on the window-seat with the Marshal
Leb&oelig;uf. The only topic during that interesting
conversation was the execution of Troppmann. It
was the great event of the week.</p>

<p>At two o'clock we left&mdash;the baroness, I, and the
baron. For there was a husband, who for the time
being was crowded in the corner of the carriage,
and hidden under the mass of my skirts and of my
train, which was thrown back on him all in a heap.</p>

<p>&quot;Confess, Edward,&quot; said the little baroness&mdash;confess
that I was pretty to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And my dress?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, charming!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You say that indolently, without spirit or enthusiasm.
I know you well. You think I've been
extravagant. Well, indeed I haven't. Do you
know how much this dress cost me? Four hundred
francs&mdash;not a centime more.&quot;</p>

<p>We arrived home, which was a step from the
Tuileries, in the Place Vend&ocirc;me. The baron went
to his rooms, the baroness to hers; and while Hermance,
the maid, cleverly and swiftly untied all my
rosettes and took out the pins, the little baroness
kept repeating: &quot;How becoming this dress is to
me! And I seem to become it, too. I shall wear
it on Thursday, Hermance, to go to the Austrian
Embassy. Wait a minute, till I see the effect of
the butterfly in the back. Bring the lamp nearer;
nearer yet. Yes, that's it. Ah, how pretty it is!
I am enchanted with this dress, Hermance&mdash;really
enchanted!&quot;</p>

<p>If the little baroness was enchanted with me, I
was equally enchanted with the baroness. We two
made the most tender, the most intimate, and the
most united of families. We comprehended, understood,
and completed each other so well. I
had not to do with one of those mechanical dolls&mdash;stupidly
and brutally laced into a padded corset.
Between the little baroness and myself there was
absolutely nothing but lace and fine linen. We
could confidentially and surely depend on one another.
The beauty of the little baroness was a real
beauty, without garniture, conjuring, or trickery.</p>

<p>So the following Thursday I went to the Austrian
Embassy, and a week later to the Princess
Mathilde's. But, alas! the next morning the little
baroness said to her maid: &quot;Hermance, take that
dress to the reserve. I love it, and I'd wear it
every evening; but it has been seen sufficiently
for this winter. Yesterday several people said to
me, 'Ah, that's your dress of the Tuileries; it's
your dress of the Austrian Embassy.' It must be
given up till next year. Good-bye, dear little
dress.&quot;</p>

<p>And, having said that, she placed her charming
lips at hap-hazard among my laces and kissed me
in the dearest way in the world. Ah, how pleased
and proud I was of that childish and sweet fellowship!
I remembered that the evening before, on
our return, the little baroness had kissed her
husband; but the kiss she had given him was a
quick, dry kiss&mdash;one of those hurried kisses with
which one wishes to get through; whereas my kiss
had been prolonged and passionate. She had
cordiality for the baron, and love for me. The
little baroness wasn't twenty, and she was a coquette
to the core. I say this, in the first place,
to excuse her, and, in the second place, to give an
exact impression of her character.</p>

<p>So at noon, in the arms of Hermance, I made
my entry to the reserve. It was a dormitory of
dresses, an immense room on the third story, very
large, and lined with wardrobes of white oak, carefully
locked. In the middle of the room was an
ottoman, on which Hermance deposited me; after
which she slid back ten or twelve wardrobe doors,
one after the other. Dresses upon dresses! I
should never be able to tell how many. All were
hung in the air by silk tape on big triangles. Hermance,
however, seemed much embarrassed.</p>

<p>&quot;In the reserve,&quot; she murmured, &quot;in the reserve;
that is easy to say. But where is there any
room? And this one needs a lot.&quot; At last Hermance,
after having given a number of little taps
to the right and left, succeeded in making a sort of
slit, into which I had great difficulty in sliding.
Hermance gave me and my neighbors some more
little taps to lump us together, and then shut the
door. Darkness reigned. I was placed between a
blue velvet dress and a mauve satin one.</p>

<p>Towards the end of April we received a visit
from the little baroness, and in consequence of
that visit there was great disturbance. Winter
dresses were hung up; spring dresses were got
down. At the beginning of July another visit,
another disturbance&mdash;entry of the costumes from
the races; departure of others for the watering-places.
I lost my neighbor to the right, the mauve
dress, and kept my neighbor on the left, the blue
dress, a cross and crabbed person who was forever
groaning, complaining, and saying to me, &quot;Oh, my
dear, you do take up so much room; do get out of
the way a little.&quot; I must admit that the poor blue
velvet dress was much to be pitied. It was three
years old, having been a part of the little baroness's
trousseau, and had never been worn. &quot;A high-neck
blue velvet dress, at my age, with my shoulders
and arms!&quot; had exclaimed the little baroness;
&quot;I should look like a grandmother!&quot; Thus it was
decreed, and the unfortunate blue dress had gone
from the trousseau straight to the reserve.</p>

<p>A week or ten days after the departure of the
dresses for Baden-Baden we heard a noise, the
voices of women, and all the doors were opened.
It was the little baroness, who had brought her
friend the Countess N&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>&quot;Sit there, my dear, on that ottoman,&quot; said the
little baroness. &quot;I have come to look over my
dresses. I am very hurried; I arrived but just
now from Baden, and I start again to-night for
Anjou. We can chatter while Hermance shows
me the dresses. Oh, those Prussians, my dear, the
monsters! We had to run away, Blanche and myself,
like thieves. (Very simple dresses, Hermance,
every-day dresses, and walking and boating dresses.)
Yes, my dear, like thieves! They threw stones at
us, real stones, in the Avenue of Lichtental, and
called us 'Rascally Frenchwomen! French rabble!'
The Emperor did well to declare war against such
people. (Dresses for horseback, Hermance&mdash;my
brown riding-habit.) At any rate, there's no need
to worry. My husband dined yesterday with Guy;
you know, the tall Guy, who is an aide of Leb&oelig;uf.
Well, we are ready, admirably ready, and the Prussians
not at all. (Very simple, I said, Hermance.
You are showing me ball-dresses. I don't intend
to dance during the war.) And then, my dear, it
seems that this war was absolutely necessary from
a dynastic point of view. I don't quite know
why, but I tell it to you as I heard it. (These
dozen dresses, Hermance, will be sufficient. But
there are thirteen. I never could have thirteen.
Take away the green one; or, no, add another&mdash;that
blue one; that's all.) Now let's go down, my
dear.&quot;</p>

<p>Whereupon she departed. So war was declared,
and with Prussia. I was much moved. I was a
French dress and a Bonapartist dress. I was
afraid for France and afraid for the dynasty, but the
words of the tall Guy were so perfectly reassuring.</p>

<p>For two months there was no news; but about
the 10th of September the little baroness arrived
with Hermance. She was very pale, poor little
baroness&mdash;very pale and agitated.</p>

<p>&quot;Dark dresses, Hermance,&quot; she said, &quot;black
dresses. I know! What remains of Aunt Pauline's
mourning? There must remain quite a lot
of things. You see, I am too sad&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if madame expects to remain long in England?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! as long as the Republic lasts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then it may be a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean&mdash;a long time? What <i>do</i>
you mean, Hermance? Who can tell you such
things?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems to me that if I were madame I'd take
for precaution's sake a few winter dresses, a few
evening-dresses&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Evening-dresses! Why, what are you thinking
of? I shall go nowhere, Hermance, alone in England,
without my husband, who stays in Paris in
the National Guard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if madame should go to see their Majesties
in England?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, of course I shall, Hermance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's because I know madame's feelings
and views that&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are right; put in some evening-dresses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will madame take her last white satin dress?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, not that one; it would be too sad a
memory for the Empress, who noticed it at the last
ball at the Tuileries. And then the dress wouldn't
stand the voyage. My poor white satin dress!
Shall I ever wear it again?&quot;</p>

<p>That is why I did not emigrate, and how I found
myself blockaded in Paris during the siege. From
the few words that we had heard of the conversation
of the little baroness and Hermance we had a
pretty clear idea of the situation. The Empire was
overthrown and the Republic proclaimed. The
Republic! There were among us several old family
laces who had seen the first Republic&mdash;that of
'93. The Reign of Terror! Ah, what tales they
told us! The fall of the Empire, however, did not
displease these old laces, who were all Legitimists
or Orleanists. In my neighborhood, on a gooseberry
satin skirt, there were four flounces of lace
who had had the honor of attending the coronation
of Charles X., and who were delighted, and kept
saying to us: &quot;The Bonapartes brought about invasion;
invasion brings back the Bourbons. Long
live Henry V.!&quot;</p>

<p>We all had, however, a common preoccupation.
Should we remain in style? We were nearly all
startling, risky, and loud&mdash;so much so that we were
quite anxious, except three or four quiet dresses,
velvet and dark cloth dresses, who joined in the
chorus with the old laces, and said to us: &quot;Ah,
here's an end to the carnival, to this masquerade
of an empire! Republic or monarchy, little we care;
we are sensible and in good taste.&quot; We felt they were
somewhat in the right in talking thus. From September
to February we remained shut up in the wardrobes,
wrangling with each other, listening to the
cannon, and knowing nothing of what was going on.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of February all the doors
were opened. It was the little baroness&mdash;the little
baroness!</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;my dresses, my beloved
dresses, there they are; how happy I am to see
them!&quot;</p>

<p>We could say nothing; but we, too, were very
happy to see the little baroness.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, then, Hermance,&quot; continued the little
baroness, &quot;let us hunt around a little. What can
I take to Bordeaux? After such disasters I must
have quiet and sombre dresses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Madame hasn't very many.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I beg your pardon, Hermance, I have dark
dresses&mdash;this one and that one. The blue velvet
dress! The blue velvet dress is just the thing, and
I've never worn it.&quot;</p>

<p>And so my neighbor the blue dress was taken
down, and was at last going to make her first appearance
in the world. However, the little baroness
herself, with great activity, rummaged round in
the wardrobes.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, nothing,&quot; she said; &quot;four or five
dresses only. All the rest are impossible, and
would not accord with the Government we shall
have in Bordeaux. Well, I shall be obliged to have
some republican dresses made&mdash;very moderate republican,
but still republican.&quot;</p>

<p>The little baroness went away, to come back a
month later, always with Hermance, who was an excellent
maid, and much thought of by her mistress.
New deliberation.</p>

<p>&quot;Hermance,&quot; said the little baroness, &quot;what can
I take to Versailles? I think we shall be able to
have a little more freedom. There will be receptions
and dinners with M. Thiers; then the princes
are coming. I might risk transition dresses. Do
you know what I mean by that, Hermance&mdash;transition
dresses?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perfectly, madame&mdash;pearl grays, mauves, violets,
lilacs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that's it, Hermance; light but quiet colors.
You are an invaluable maid. You understand me
perfectly.&quot;</p>

<p>The little baroness started for Versailles with a
collection of transition dresses. There must have
been twenty. It was a good beginning, and filled
us with hope. She had begun at Bordeaux with
sombre colors, and continued on at Versailles with
light ones, Versailles was evidently only a stepping-stone
between Bordeaux and Paris. The little
baroness was soon coming back to Paris, and once
the little baroness was in Paris we could feel assured
that we should not stay long in the wardrobes.</p>

<p>But it happened that a few days after the departure
of the little baroness for Versailles we heard
loud firing beneath the windows of the house (we
lived in the Place Vend&ocirc;me). Was it another revolt,
another revolution? For a week nothing more
was heard; there was silence. Then at the end of
that week the cannonade began around Paris worse
than ever. Was the war recommencing with the
Prussians? Was it a new siege?</p>

<p>The days passed, and the boom of the cannon
continued. Finally, one morning there was a great
racket in the court-yard of our house. Cries,
threats, oaths! The noise came up and up. Great
blows with the butt ends of muskets were struck
on the wardrobe doors. They were smashed in
and we perceived eight or ten slovenly looking,
dirty, and bearded men. Among these men was a
woman, a little brunette; fairly pretty, I must say,
but queerly gotten up. A black dress with a short
skirt, little boots with red bows, a round gray felt
hat with a large red plume, and a sort of red scarf
worn crosswise. It was a peculiar style, but it was
style all the same.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, oh!&quot; exclaimed the little woman, &quot;here's
luck! What a lot of dresses! Well, clear away all
this, sergeant, and take those duds to headquarters.&quot;</p>

<p>Then all those men threw themselves upon us
with a sort of fury. We felt ourselves gripped and
dishonored by coarse, dirty hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't soil them too much, citizens,&quot; the little
woman would cry. &quot;Do them up in packages, and
take the packages down to the ammunition-wagon.&quot;</p>

<p>The headquarters was the apartment of the young
lady of the red plume. Our new mistress was the
wife of a general of the Commune. We were destined
to remain official dresses. Official during the
Empire, and official during the Commune. The
first thought of Mme. General was to hold a review
of us, and I had the honor of being the object of
her special attention and admiration.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, look, &Eacute;mile!&quot; (&Eacute;mile was the General.)
&quot;Look! this is the toniest of the whole concern.
I'll keep it for the Tuileries.&quot;</p>

<p>I was to be kept for the Tuileries! What tales
of woe and what lamentations there were in the
sort of alcove where we were thrown like rags!
Mme. General went into society every evening, and
never put on the same dress twice. My poor companions
the day after told me their adventures of
the day before. This one had dined at Citizen
Raoul Rigault's, the Pr&eacute;fecture of Police; that one
attended a performance of &quot;Andromaque&quot; at the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, in the Empress's box, etc. At
last it was my turn. The 17th of May was the
day of the grand concert at the Tuileries.</p>

<p>Oh, my dear little baroness, what had become
of you? Where were your long soft muslin petticoats
and your fine white satin corsets? Where
were your transparent linen chemisettes? Mme.
General had coarse petticoats of starched calico.
Mme. General wore such a corset! Mme. General
had such a crinoline! My poor skirts of lace and
satin were abominably stiffened and tossed about
by the hard crinoline hoops. As to the basque,
the strange thing happened that the basque of the
little baroness was much too tight for Mme. General
at the waist, and, on the contrary, above the waist
it was&mdash;I really do not know how to explain such
things. At any rate, it was just the opposite of
small, so much so that it had to be padded. Horrible!
Most horrible!</p>

<p>At ten that evening I was climbing for the second
time the grand staircase of the Tuileries, in
the midst of a dense and ignoble mob. One of the
General's aides-de-camp tried in vain to open a passage.</p>

<p>&quot;Room, room, for the wife of the General!&quot; he
cried.</p>

<p>Much they cared for the wife of the General!
Great big boots trampled on my train, sharp spurs
tore my laces, and the bones of the corsets of Mme.
General hurt me terribly.</p>

<p>At midnight I returned to Mme. General's den. I
returned in rags, shreds, soiled, dishonored, and
stained with wine, tobacco, and mud. A hateful
little maid brutally tore me from the shoulders of
Mme. General, and said to her mistress:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, madame, was it beautiful?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Victoria,&quot; replied Mme. General, &quot;it was too
mixed. But do hurry up! tear it off if it won't come.
I know where to find others at the same price.&quot;</p>

<p>And I was thrown like a rag on a heap of pieces.
The heap of pieces was composed of ball-dresses
of the little baroness.</p>

<p>One morning, three or four days later, the aide-de-camp
rushed in, crying, &quot;The Versaillists! The
Versaillists are in Paris!&quot;</p>

<p>Thereupon Mme. General put on a sort of military
costume, took two revolvers, filled them with cartridges,
and hung them on a black leather belt
which she wore around her waist. &quot;Where is the
General?&quot; she said to the aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>&quot;At the Tuileries.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, I shall go there with you.&quot; And
on that she departed, with her little gray felt hat
jauntily tilted over her ear.</p>

<p>The cannonade and firing redoubled and came
nearer. Evidently there was fighting very near us,
quite close to us. The next day towards noon we
saw them both come back, the General and Mme.
General. And in what a condition! Panting,
frightened, forbidding, with clothes white with
dust, and hands and faces black with powder.
The General was wounded in the left hand, he
had twisted around his wrist a handkerchief bathed
in blood.</p>

<p>&quot;Does your arm hurt you?&quot; Mme. General said
to him.</p>

<p>&quot;It stings a little, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are they following us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I think so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Listen! There are noises, shouts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look out of the window without showing yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The red trousers! They are here!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lock and bolt the door. Get the revolvers and
load them. I can't on account of my arm. This
wound is a bore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are so pale!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; I am losing blood&mdash;a good deal of blood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are coming up the stairs!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Into the alcove&mdash;let us go into the alcove, on
the dresses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here they are!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Give me the revolver.&quot;</p>

<p>The door gave way violently under the hammering
of the butts of the guns. A shower of bullets
fell on us and around us. The General, with a single
movement, fell heavily at full length on the bed
of silk, muslin, and laces that we made for him.
Three or four men with red trousers threw themselves
on Mme. General, who fought, bit, and
screamed, &quot;Assassins! assassins!&quot;</p>

<p>A soldier tore away the bell-cord, firmly tied her
hands, and carried her away like a bundle. She
continued to repeat, in a strangled voice, &quot;Assassins!
assassins!&quot; The soldiers approached the alcove
and looked at the General. &quot;As to him,&quot; they
said, &quot;he's done for; he doesn't need anything
more. Let's be off.&quot;</p>

<p>They left us, and we remained there for two days,
crushed beneath that corpse and covered with blood.
Finally, at the end of those two days, a man arrived
who was called a Commissioner, and who wore a
tricolored scarf around his waist. &quot;This corpse
has been forgotten,&quot; he said. &quot;Take it away.&quot;</p>

<p>They tried to lift the body, but with fingers stiffened
by death the General held my big cherry satin
butterfly. They had nearly to break his fingers to
get it out.</p>

<p>Meantime the Commissioner examined and
searched curiously among that brilliant heap of
rags on which the General had died. My waist
appeared to catch his eye. &quot;Here is a mark,&quot; he
said to one of his men&mdash;&quot;a mark inside the waist,
with the name and number of the maker. We can
learn where these dresses came from. Wrap this
waist in a newspaper and I'll take it.&quot;</p>

<p>They wrapped me in an old number of the <i>Official
Journal of the Commune</i>. The following day we
went to M. Worth, the Commissioner and I. The
conversation was not long.</p>

<p>&quot;Was this dress made by you?&quot; the Commissioner
asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; here's the mark.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And for whom was it made?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Number 18,223. Wait a moment; I'll consult
my books.&quot; The dress-maker came back in five
minutes, and said to the Commissioner, &quot;It was for
the Baroness Z&mdash;&mdash; that I made this dress, eighteen
months ago, and it isn't paid for.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_INSURGENT" id="THE_INSURGENT"></a>THE INSURGENT</h2>


<p>&quot;Prisoner,&quot; said the President of the Council
of War, &quot;have you anything to add in your defence?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, colonel,&quot; replied the prisoner. &quot;The little
lawyer you assigned me defended me according to
his idea; I want to defend myself according to
mine.</p>

<p>&quot;My name is Martin (Lewis Joseph). I am fifty-five
years old. My father was a locksmith. He had
a little shop in the upper part of the Saint-Martin
Quarter, and had a fair business. We just
existed. I learned to read in the <i>National</i>, which
was, I believe, the paper of M. Thiers.</p>

<p>&quot;On the 27th of July, 1830, my father went out
very early. That evening, at ten o'clock, he was
brought back to us on a litter, dying. He had received
a bullet in the chest. Beside him on the
litter was his musket.</p>

<p>&quot;'Take it,' he said to me. 'I give it to you; and
every time there is a riot, be against the Government&mdash;always,
always, always!'</p>

<p>&quot;An hour later he was dead. I went out in the
night. At the first barricade I stopped and offered
myself; a man examined me by the light of a lantern.
'A child!' he exclaimed. I was not fifteen.
I was very slight and undersized. I answered: 'A
child, maybe, but my father was killed two hours
ago. He gave me his musket. Teach me how to
use it.'</p>

<p>&quot;From that moment I became what I have always
been for forty years, an insurgent! If I fought
during the Commune, it was not because I was
forced, nor for the thirty sous; it was from taste,
from pleasure, from habit, from routine.</p>

<p>&quot;In 1830 I behaved rather bravely at the attack
on the Louvre. The urchin who first scaled the
gate beneath the bullets of the Swiss was I. I received
the Medal of July. But the shopkeepers
gave us a king. It had all to be done over. I
joined a secret society; I learned to melt bullets,
to make powder&mdash;in short, I completed my education,
and I waited.</p>

<p>&quot;I had to wait nearly two years. On June 5,
1832, at noon, in front of the Madeleine, I was the
first to unharness one of the horses of the hearse
of General Lamarque. I passed the day in shouting,
'Long live Lafayette!' and I passed the night
in making barricades. The next morning we were
attacked by the regulars. In the evening, towards
four o'clock, we were blocked, cannonaded, swept
with grape-shot, and crushed back into the Church
of Saint-M&eacute;ry. I had a bullet and three bayonet-stabs
in my body when I was picked up by the soldiers
from the stone floor of a little chapel to the
left&mdash;the Chapel of St. John. I have often gone
back to that little chapel&mdash;not to pray, I wasn't
brought up with such ideas&mdash;but to see the stains
of my blood which still remain on the stones.</p>

<p>&quot;On account of my youth I received a ten-year
sentence. I was sent to Mont Saint-Michel. That
was why I didn't take part in the riots of 1834.
If I had been free I should have fought in Rue
Transnonian as I had fought in Rue Saint-M&eacute;ry&mdash;'against
the Government&mdash;always, always, always!'
It was my father's last word; it was my gospel, my
religion. I call that my catechism in six words. I
came out of prison in 1842, and I again began to
wait.</p>

<p>&quot;The revolution of '48 was made without effort.
The shopkeepers were stupid and cowardly. They
were neither for nor against us. The municipal
guards alone defended themselves. We had a little
trouble in taking the guard-house of the Ch&acirc;teau
d'Eau. On the evening of February 24th I remained
three or four hours on the square before the H&ocirc;tel
de Ville. The members of the Provisional Government,
one after another, made speeches to us&mdash;said
that we were heroes, great citizens, the foremost nation
in the world, that we had broken the bonds of
tyranny. After having fed us on these fine speeches,
they gave us a republic which wasn't any better
than the monarchy we had overthrown.</p>

<p>&quot;In June I took up my musket again, but on that
occasion we were not successful. I was arrested,
sentenced, and sent to Cayenne. It seems that I
behaved well there. One day I saved a captain
of marines from drowning. Observe that I should
most certainly have shot at that captain if he had
been on one side of a barricade and I on the other;
but a man who is drowning, dying&mdash;in short, I received
my pardon, I came back to France in 1852,
after the Coup d'&Eacute;tat; I had missed the insurrection
of 1851.</p>

<p>&quot;At Cayenne I had made friends with a tailor
named Barnard. Six months after my departure
for France, Barnard died. I went to see his widow.
She was in want. I married her. We had a son
in 1854&mdash;you will understand presently why I speak
to you of my wife and my son. But you must already
suspect that an insurgent who marries the
widow of an insurgent does not have royalist children.</p>

<p>&quot;Under the Empire there was nothing to do.
The police were very strict. We were dispersed,
disarmed. I worked, I brought up my son with
the ideas that my father had given me. The wait
was long. Rochefort, Gambetta, public reunions&mdash;all
that put us in motion again.</p>

<p>&quot;On the first important occasion I showed myself.
I was one of that little band who assaulted
the barracks of the firemen of Villette. Only there
we made a mistake. We killed a fireman, unnecessarily,
I was caught and thrown into prison,
but the Government of the Fourth of September
liberated us, from which I concluded that we did
right to attack those barracks and kill the fireman,
even unnecessarily.</p>

<p>&quot;The siege began. I immediately opposed the
Government, on the side of the Commune. I
marched against the H&ocirc;tel de Ville on the 31st of
October and on the 22d of January. I liked revolt
for revolt's sake. An insurgent&mdash;I told you in the
beginning I am an insurgent. I cannot hear a discussion
without taking part, nor see a riot without
running to it, nor a barricade without bringing my
paving-stone. It's in the blood.</p>

<p>&quot;And then, besides, I wasn't quite ignorant, and
I said to myself, It is only necessary to succeed
thoroughly some day, and then, in our turn, we
shall be the Government, and it will be better than
with all these lawyers, who place themselves behind
us during the battle, and pass ahead after the
victory.'</p>

<p>&quot;The 18th of March came, and naturally I was
in it. I shouted 'Hurrah for the regulars!' I fraternized
with the army. I went to the H&ocirc;tel de
Ville. I found a government already at work. It was
absolutely the same as on the 24th of February.</p>

<p>&quot;Now you tell me that that insurrection was not
lawful. That is possible, but I don't quite see why
not. I begin to get muddled&mdash;about these insurrections
which are a duty and those which are a
crime! I do not clearly see the difference.</p>

<p>&quot;I shot at the Versailles troops in 1871, as I had
shot at the royal guard in 1830 and on the municipals
in 1848. After 1830 I received the Medal of
July; after 1848 the compliments of M. de Lamartine.
This time I am going to get transportation
or death.</p>

<p>&quot;There are insurrections which please you. You
raise columns to them, you give their names to
streets, you give yourselves the offices, the promotions,
and the big salaries, and we folks, who made
the revolution, you call us great citizens, heroes, a
nation of brave men, etc. That's the coin we are
paid with.</p>

<p>&quot;And then there are other insurrections which
displease you. As a result, transportation, death.
Well, you see, if you hadn't complimented us so
after the first ones, perhaps we wouldn't have made
the last. If you hadn't raised the Column of July
at the entrance of our neighborhood, we wouldn't
perhaps have gone and demolished the Vend&ocirc;me
Column in your neighborhood. Those two penny
trumpets didn't agree. One had to upset the other,
and that is what happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, why I threw away my captain's uniform
on the 26th of May, why I was in a blouse when I
was arrested, I will tell you. When I learned that
the gentlemen of the Commune, instead of coming
to shoot with us behind the barricades, were at
the H&ocirc;tel de Ville distributing among themselves
thousand-franc notes, were shaving their beards,
dyeing their hair, and hiding themselves in caves,
I did not wish to keep the shoulder-straps they had
given me.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, shoulder-straps embarrassed me. 'Captain
Martin' sounded idiotic. 'Insurgent Martin'&mdash;why,
that's well and good. I wanted to end as
I had begun, die as my father had died, as a rioter
in a riot, as a barricader behind a barricade.</p>

<p>&quot;I could not get killed. I got caught. I belong
to you. But I wish to beg a favor of you. I have
a son, a child of seventeen; he is at Cherbourg, on
the hulks. He fought, it is true, and he does not
deny it; but it is I who put a musket in his hand,
it is I who told him that his duty was there. He
listened to me. He obeyed me. That is all his
crime. Do not sentence him too harshly.</p>

<p>&quot;As for me, you have got me; do not let me go,
that's the advice I give you. I am too old to mend;
and then, what can you expect? Nothing can
change it. I was born on the wrong side of the
barricade.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHINESE_AMBASSADOR" id="THE_CHINESE_AMBASSADOR"></a>THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR</h2>


<p>In the beginning of the year 1870 some English
and French residents had been massacred in
China. Reparation was demanded. His Excellency
Tchong-Keon, Tutor of the Heir-apparent and
Vice-President of the War Department, was sent
to Europe as Ambassador Extraordinary to the English
and French governments.</p>

<p>Tchong-Keon has recently published at Pekin a
very curious account of his voyage. One of my
friends who lives in Shanghai, and who possesses
the rare talent of being able to read Chinese easily,
sent me this faithful translation of a part of Tchong-Keon's
book:</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>HAVRE, <i>September 12, 1870</i>.</p>

<p>I land, and I make myself known. I am the
Ambassador of the Emperor of China. I bear
apologies to the Emperor of the French, and presents
to the Empress. There is no Emperor and no
Empress. A Republic has been proclaimed. I
am much embarrassed. Shall I offer the apologies
and presents that were intended for the Empire to
the Republic?</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>HAVRE, <i>September 14, 1870</i>.</p>

<p>After much reflection, I shall offer the apologies
and keep the presents.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>HAVRE, <i>September 26, 1870</i>.</p>

<p>Yes; but to whom shall I carry the apologies, and
to whom shall I present them? The Government
of the French Republic is divided in two: there is
one part in Paris and one part in Tours. To go to
Paris is not to be thought of. Paris is besieged
and blockaded by the Prussians. I shall go to
Tours.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>HAVRE, <i>October 2, 1870</i>.</p>

<p>I did not go, and I shall not go, to Tours. I received
yesterday a visit from the correspondent
of the <i>Times</i>, a most agreeable and sensible man.
I told him that I intended going to Tours.</p>

<p>&quot;To Tours! What do you want in Tours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To present the apologies of my master to the
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the French Republic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But that minister isn't in Tours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And where is he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Blockaded in Paris.&quot;</p>

<p>A Minister of Foreign Affairs who is blockaded
in a besieged town seemed to me most extraordinary.</p>

<p>&quot;And why,&quot; the correspondent of the <i>Times</i>
asked me, &quot;do you bring apologies to the French
Government?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because we massacred some French residents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;French residents! That's of no importance
nowadays. France no longer exists. You can, if
it amuses you, throw all the French residents into
the sea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We also thoughtlessly massacred some English
residents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You massacred some English residents! Oh,
that's very different! England is still a great
nation. And you have brought apologies to Queen
Victoria?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, apologies and presents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go to London, go straight to London, and don't
bother about France; there is no France.&quot;</p>

<p>The correspondent of the <i>Times</i> looked quite
happy when he spoke those words: &quot;there is no
France.&quot;</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>LONDON, <i>October 10, 1870</i>.</p>

<p>I've seen the Queen of England. She received
me very cordially. She has accepted the apologies;
she has accepted the presents.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>LONDON, <i>October 12, 1870</i>.</p>

<p>Had a long conversation with Lord Granville,
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Queen of England.
I explained to his Excellency that I meant
to go home at once, and that I feel I need not pay
further attention to my French embassy, as France
no longer exists. Lord Granville answered me:</p>

<p>&quot;Don't go away so soon; you will perhaps be
obliged to come back, and sooner than you imagine.
France is an extraordinary country, which picks up
very quickly. Await the end of the war, and then
you can take your apologies to the Government that
France will have decided on giving itself. Till then
remain in England. We shall be most happy to offer
you our hospitality.&quot;</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>LONDON, <i>November 3, 1870</i>.</p>

<p>I did not return to China. I am waiting in London
till the Minister of Foreign Affairs is not besieged,
and till there is some way of laying one's
hands on the French Government. There are many
Parisians here who escaped from their country on
account of the war. I dined yesterday with his
Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales. Three Parisian
women, all three young, and all three pretty,
took possession of me after dinner. We had a very
interesting conversation in English.</p>

<p>&quot;You are looking for the French Government,
the legitimate Government?&quot; said the first of these
Parisians. &quot;Why, it is here in England, half an hour
from London. To-morrow go to the Waterloo station
and buy a ticket for Chiselhurst, and there
you will find Napoleon III., who is, and has never
ceased to be, the Emperor of the French.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't listen to her, Mr. Ambassador,&quot; laughingly
said the second Parisian, &quot;don't listen to her;
she is a terrible Bonapartist. Yes, the true sovereign
of France is in England, quite near London,
but not at Chiselhurst; and it is not the Waterloo
station you must go to, but the Victoria station.
You mustn't take a ticket for Chiselhurst, but for
Twickenham, and there you will find at Orleans
House his Royal Highness the Count of Paris.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't listen to her, Mr. Ambassador,&quot; exclaimed
in turn, and also laughing, the third Parisian, &quot;don't
listen to her; she is a terrible revolutionist! The
Count of Paris is not the heir to the throne of
France. To find the legitimate King you must go
a little farther than Chiselhurst or Twickenham;
you must go to Austria, to the Frohsdorf Palace.
The King of France&mdash;he is the descendant of
Henry IV.&mdash;is the Count of Chambord.&quot;</p>

<p>If I count aright, that makes three legitimate
sovereigns, and all three deposed. Never in China
have we had anything of that sort. Our old dynasty
has had to fight against the invasions of the
Mongols and against the insurrections of the Taipings.
But three legitimate sovereigns for the same
country, for a single throne! One has to come to
Europe to see such things.</p>

<p>However, the three Parisians gayly discussed the
matter, and seemed to be the best friends in the
world.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>LONDON, <i>November 15, 1870</i>.</p>

<p>As a sequel to the three Frenchwomen, representing
three different monarchs, I met, this evening,
at Lord Granville's, three Frenchmen representing
three different republics.</p>

<p>The first asked me why I didn't go to Tours.</p>

<p>&quot;You will find there,&quot; he said to me, &quot;the authorized
representatives of the French Republic,
and in addressing yourself to M. Gambetta you
are addressing France&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't do that, Mr. Ambassador!&quot; exclaimed the
second Frenchman; &quot;the real Government of the
real French Republic is shut up in Paris. M. Jules
Favre alone can officially receive your visit and
your apologies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Republic of Paris isn't worth more than
the Republic of Tours,&quot; the third Frenchman then
told me. &quot;If we have a Republic in France, it will
be neither the Republic of M. Gambetta nor the
Republic of M. Jules Favre.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And whose Republic then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Republic of M. Thiers&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Whereupon the three Frenchmen began to dispute
in earnest. They were very red, shouted loudly, and
made violent gestures. The discussion about the
three monarchies had been much gentler and much
more agreeable than the discussion about the three
republics.</p>

<p>During the evening these Frenchmen managed to
slip into my ear, in turn, two or three little phrases
of this kind:</p>

<p>&quot;Don't listen,&quot; the first one said to me, &quot;to that
partisan of the Government of Paris; he is a lawyer
who has come here with a commission from
M. Jules Favre. So you see he has a big salary,
and as he wishes to keep it&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't listen,&quot; the second one said to me, &quot;to
that partisan of the alleged Republic of M. Thiers;
he is only a monarchist, a disguised Orleanist&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't listen,&quot; the third one said to me, &quot;to
that partisan of the Republic of Tours; he is a gentleman
who has come to England to get a loan for
the benefit of the Government of Tours; so, as he
expects to get a lot of money&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Thus I am, if I reckon correctly, face to face with
six governments&mdash;three monarchies and three republics.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>LONDON, <i>December 6, 1870</i>.</p>

<p>I think that his Excellency, M. de Bernstoff,
Prussian Ambassador to England, takes pleasure
in making fun of me. I never meet him but that
he announces to me that Paris will capitulate the
next day. The next day arrives and Paris does not
capitulate. However, this evening his Excellency
looked so perfectly sure of what he was saying that
I think I can prepare to start for Paris.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>PARIS, <i>February 20, 1871</i>.</p>

<p>I only left on the 10th of February. At last I am
in Paris. I travelled slowly, by short stages. What
a lot of burned villages! What a lot of sacked
houses! What a lot of devastated forests, dug-up
woods, and bridges and railroads destroyed! And
these Europeans treat us as barbarians!</p>

<p>However, among all these ruins there is one the
sight of which filled me with the keenest joy. The
palace of Saint-Cloud was the summer palace of the
Emperor Napoleon, and not a stone upon a stone
remains. I contemplated curiously, eagerly, and for
a long time the blackened ruins of this palace.
Pieces of old Chinese vases were hidden in the
heaps of rubbish among the wreck of marble and
fragments of shell.</p>

<p>Where did those old Chinese vases come from?
Perhaps from the summer palace of our Emperor,
from that palace which was devastated, burned,
and destroyed by those English and French soldiers
who came to bring us civilization.</p>

<p>I was extremely well received by the English,
who overwhelmed me with invitations and kindnesses;
but none the less I hope that the palaces of
Buckingham and Windsor will also have their turn.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>PARIS, <i>February 25, 1871</i>.</p>

<p>I have written to M. Jules Favre to let him
know that I have been waiting six months for
the opportunity of presenting to him the compliments
and apologies of the Emperor of China.
M. Jules Favre answered me that he is obliged
to start for Bordeaux. I shall have an audience in
the beginning of March.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>PARIS, <i>March 7, 1871</i>.</p>

<p>Another letter from M. Jules Favre. He is expected
at Frankfort by M. de Bismarck. My audience
is again put off.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>PARIS, <i>March 17, 1871</i>.</p>

<p>At last, to-morrow, March 18th, at four o'clock,
I am to be received by M. Jules Favre at the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>PARIS, <i>March 18, 1871</i>.</p>

<p>We dressed ourselves, I and my two secretaries,
in our official costumes, and departed at three
o'clock, accompanied by an interpreter. We arrived.
The court of the house was filled with people
who appeared busy and hurried, and who came
and went, carrying cases and packages. The interpreter,
after having exchanged several words
with an employee of the ministry, said to me:</p>

<p>&quot;Something serious has happened&mdash;an insurrection.
The Government is again obliged to change
its capital!&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment a door opened, and M. Jules
Favre himself appeared with a large portfolio under
his arm. He explained to the interpreter that
I should have my audience at Versailles in several
days, and having made me a profound bow, which
I returned him, he ran away with his large portfolio.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>VERSAILLES, <i>March 19, 1871</i>.</p>

<p>I had to leave Paris at twelve o'clock in a great
hurry. There really is a new Government at Paris.
This Government is not one of the three monarchies,
nor one of the three republics. It is a seventh
arrangement, which is called the <i>Commune</i>.
This morning an armed troop of men surrounded
the house where I live. It seems that the new
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Paris of the Commune
would have been charmed to receive a Chinese
ambassador. They had come to carry me off.
I had time to escape. It is not the Minister of
Foreign Affairs in Paris that I ought to see, it is the
Minister of Foreign Affairs in Versailles.</p>

<p>Good heavens, how complicated it all is! And
when shall I be able to put my hand on this intangible
person, who is now blockaded in Paris
and now chased out of Paris?</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>VERSAILLES, <i>April 6, 1871</i>.</p>

<p>At last, yesterday, I had the honor of being received
by his Excellency, and we discussed the
events that had occurred in Paris.</p>

<p>&quot;This insurrection,&quot; M. Jules Favre said to me,
&quot;is the most formidable and the most extraordinary
that has ever broken out.&quot;</p>

<p>I could not allow such a great historical error to
pass. I answered M. Jules Favre that we had
had in China for millions of years socialists and
socialistic uprisings; that the French Communists
were but rough imitators of our Chinese Taipings;
that we had had in 1230 a siege at Nankin which
had lasted seven years, etc. In short, these Europeans
are only beginning again our history with
less grandeur and more barbarity.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>VERSAILLES, <i>May 15, 1871</i>.</p>

<p>My mission is ended; I could return to China;
but all that I see here interests me extremely.
This civil war immediately succeeding a foreign
war is a very curious occurrence. There is here,
for a Chinaman, an excellent opportunity of study,
on the spot and from life, of European civilization.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>VERSAILLES, <i>May 24, 1871</i>.</p>

<p>Paris is burning, and on the terrace of the palace
of Saint-Cloud, in the midst of the ruins of that
palace, I passed my day looking at Paris burn. It
is a dead, destroyed, and annihilated city.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>PARIS, <i>June 10, 1871</i>.</p>

<p>Not at all. It is still the most beautiful city in
Europe, and the most brilliant, and the most gay.
I shall spend some time in Paris.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>PARIS, <i>June 29, 1871</i>.</p>

<p>Yesterday M. Thiers, in the Bois de Boulogne,
held a review of a hundred thousand men. Will
there always be a France?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IN_THE_EXPRESS" id="IN_THE_EXPRESS"></a>IN THE EXPRESS</h2>


<p>&quot;When one bears the name of Luynes or La
Tr&eacute;moille, I can readily understand the desire to
continue the Luynes or the La Tr&eacute;moilles; but
really when one is named Chamblard, what possible
object can there be in&mdash;Eh? Answer.&quot;</p>

<p>In this fashion young Raoul Chamblard talked
while comfortably settled back in a large red velvet
arm-chair. This happened on the 26th of March,
1892, in one of the parlor-cars of the express to
Marseilles, which had left Paris at 8.50 that morning.
It was now five minutes past nine. The train
with much racket was crossing the bridge of Charentin.
Young Chamblard was talking to his friend,
Maurice R&eacute;voille, who, after a six weeks' leave, was
going to join his regiment in Algeria.</p>

<p>The lieutenant of light cavalry responded to his
friend's question with a vague gesture. Raoul
Chamblard continued:</p>

<p>&quot;However, it's my father's fixed idea. There
must be Chamblards after me. And as papa has
but one son, it's to me he looks to do what is necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, do what is necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I am only twenty-four, my dear fellow, and
to marry at twenty-four is hard. It seems to me
that I'm still entitled to a little more fun, and even
a good deal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, have your fun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's just what I've done up to now. I have
had a first-rate time! But I've taste only for expensive
amusements. I don't know how to enjoy
myself without money, and I haven't a cent. Do
you understand? Not a cent!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You? You are very rich.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A great mistake! Upon coming of age, three
years ago, I spent what was left me by my mother.
Mother wasn't very rich; she was worth six hundred
thousand francs, not more. Papa made almost
a love-match. The six hundred thousand
francs vanished in three years, and could I decently
do anything else as the son of my father? He
is powerfully rich!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what's said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And it's very true. He has a dozen millions
which are quite his own, and can't be hurt by an
accident; and his bank still goes on, and brings
him in, one year with another, besides the interest
on his dozen millions, three or four hundred thousand
francs more. Nothing is more solid than the
Chamblard bank; it's honest, it's venerable. Papa
isn't fair to me, but I'm fair to him. When you
have a father in business, it's a good thing when
you go out not to be exposed to meet eyes which
seem to say to you, 'My dear fellow, your father
has swindled me.' Papa has but one passion:
from five to seven every day he plays piquet at
his club, at ten sous a point, and as he is an excellent
player, he wins seven times out of ten. He
keeps an account of his games with the same scrupulous
exactitude he has in all things, and he was
telling the day before yesterday that piquet this
year had brought him in six thousand five hundred
francs over and above the cost of the cards. He
has a seat in the orchestra at the opera, not for
the ballet, but for the music only; he never goes
on the stage&mdash;neither do I, for that matter. Dancers
don't attract me at all; they live in Batignolles,
in Montmartre; they always walk with
their mothers; they completely lack charm. In
short, my father is what one calls a good man.
You see I continue to be fair to him. Besides, I'm
always right. Yes, it's a very good thing to have
an honorable father, and Papa Chamblard is a model
of all virtues, and he accumulates for me with a
zeal! but I think, just at present, he accumulates
a little too much. He has cut off my income. No
marriage, no money. That's brief and decisive.
That's his programme. And he has hunted up
a wife for me&mdash;when I say one, I should say three.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Three wives!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. One morning he came to me and said:
'This must end. Look, here's a list&mdash;three splendid
matches.' There were the names, the relations,
the dowries&mdash;it was even arranged in the
order of the dowries. I had to yield and consent
to an interview with Number One. That took place
at the Salon in the Champs Elys&eacute;es. Ah, my boy,
Number One&mdash;dry, flat, bony, sallow!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why did your father&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why? Because she was the daughter, and only
daughter, of a wealthy manufacturer from Roubaix.
It was splendid! We each started with a hundred
thousand francs income, and that was to be, in the
course of time, after realized expectations, a shower
of millions! It made papa supremely happy&mdash;the
thought that all his millions in Paris would one
day make an enormous heap with all those Roubaix
millions. Millions don't frighten me, but on
the condition that they surround a pretty, a very
pretty and stylish woman&mdash;a great deal of style!
That's <i>my</i> programme. I want to be able to take
my wife to the theatres without having to blush
before the box-openers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean? Before the box-openers?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, certainly. I am known, and I've a reputation
to keep up. You see, the openers are always
the same&mdash;always; and of course they know
me. They've been in the habit of seeing me, during
the last three or four years, come with the best-known
and best-dressed women in Paris. Which
is to say, that I should never dare present myself before
them with that creature from Roubaix. They
would think I had married for money. I tried to
explain that delicately to papa, but one can't make
him hear reason. There are things which he doesn't
understand, which he can't understand. I have no
grudge against him; he's of his time, I'm of mine.
In short, I declared resolutely that I would never
marry Number One. Notice that I discoursed most
sensibly with papa. I said to him: 'You want me
to have a home' (home is his word), 'but when I
should have placed in that home a fright such as
to scare the sparrows, my home would be a horror
to me, and I should be forced, absolutely forced,
to arrange a home outside. Thus I should have a
household at home and a household outside, and
it's then that the money would fly!' But papa
won't listen to anything! He doesn't understand
that I must have a little wife who is pretty, Parisian
pretty&mdash;that is to say, original, gay, jolly, who
is looked at on the street, and stared at through
opera-glasses at the theatre, who will do me honor,
and who will set me off well. I must be able to
continue my bachelor life with her, and as long as
possible. And then there's another thing that I
can't tell papa. His name is Chamblard&mdash;it isn't
his fault; only, in consequence, I too am named
Chamblard, and it's not very agreeable, with a name
like that, to try to get on in society. And a pretty,
a very pretty, woman is the best passport. There,
look at Robineau. He has just been received into
the little club of the Rue Royale. And why? It's
not the Union or the Jockey; but never mind, one
doesn't get in there as into a hotel. And why was
Robineau received?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's because he has married a charming woman,
and this charming woman is a skater of the first
rank. She had a tremendous success on the ice
at the Bois de Boulogne. In the society columns
of all the papers there was mention of the exquisite,
delightful, and ideal Mme. Robineau. She was
in the swim at one stroke. And Robineau, he too
was in the swim. He was a member of the little
club six weeks later! Papa, he doesn't understand
the importance of these things; one can't reason
with him about it; it's all Greek to him. However,
as he had absolutely cut off my supplies, I had to
submit, and consent to an interview with Number
Two.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what was Number Two like?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my dear fellow, what was she like! She
was the daughter of a rich merchant of Antwerp.
A Belgian article! First a provincial, and then a
foreigner! Papa doesn't like Parisians. Mamma
was from Ch&acirc;tellerault, and she was indeed a saint.
Number Two happened to be in Paris; so last night,
at the Op&eacute;ra Comique, they showed me a Fleming,
who was very blond, very insipid, very masculine&mdash;a
Rubens, a true Rubens; a giantess, a colossal
woman, a head taller than I, which is to say that
materially one could not take her in a lower stage-box,
and those are the only boxes I like. On leaving
the theatre I told papa that I wouldn't have
Number Two any more than Number One, and that
I had had enough, and that I wouldn't see Number
Three. The discussion was heated. Papa went off
banging doors and repeating, 'No more money!'
I saw that it was serious. I went to bed, but I
couldn't sleep&mdash;I thought; but I could think of
nothing to save me from the fat hands of the Antwerp
girl. Suddenly, towards three in the morning,
I had an inspiration&mdash;I had an idea that I can call,
if you'll permit it, a stroke of genius.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll permit it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, genius. I knew that you left to-day for
Marseilles, and this morning I departed, English
fashion, without explanation, and in a little while,
at the first stop, at Laroche&mdash;I have looked at the
time-table, I have thought of everything&mdash;I shall
send the following despatch to my father,&quot; and Raoul
triumphantly pulled a paper out of his pocket.
&quot;It's all ready. Listen. 'M. Chamblard, 8 Rue
Rougemont, Paris, Laroche station. I left on the
express for Marseilles with Maurice. I am going to
make a voyage around the world. I sha'n't be more
than six months. I have engaged by telegraph a
state-room on the <i>Traonaddy</i> which leaves to-morrow
for Singapore. Anything rather than a
Flemish alliance! Farewell. With regrets for leaving
you, your affectionate son, Raoul Chamblard.'
My telegram's all right, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't bad, but do you seriously mean&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I shall go if, before I reach Marseilles, I
haven't an answer from papa; but I shall have one,
for two reasons. In the first place, Papa Chamblard
knows how to reason, and he will say to himself:
'What shall I gain by it? Instead of fooling
round with little white women in Paris, he will fool
round with little yellow ones at Singapore.' And
then another reason, the best one, is that Papa
Chamblard adores me, and he can't do without
me, and the little sentimental phrase at the end of
my despatch will appeal to his heart. You'll see
how it will turn out. At 11.20 my telegram will
leave Laroche; papa will receive it at half-past
twelve. And I'll bet you ten louis that at Dijon or
M&acirc;con I'll find in the wire screen of the station a
telegram addressed to me, and worded thus: 'Return;
no longer question of Antwerp marriage.'
Papa's telegram will be brief, because he is saving
and suppresses unnecessary words. Will you take
the bet?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I should lose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so. Have you the papers?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>They read three or four papers, Parisian papers,
and read them like true Parisians. It took a short
fifteen minutes. While reading they exchanged
short remarks about the new ministry, the races
at Auteuil, and Yvette Guilbert&mdash;particularly about
Yvette Guilbert. Young Chamblard had been to
hear her the day before, and he hummed the refrain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Un fiacre allait trottinant<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Cahin-caha<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hu dia! Hop l&agrave;!<br /></span>
<span>Un fiacre allait trottinant<br /></span>
<span>Jaune avec un cocher blanc.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And as the light cavalryman had never heard
Yvette Guilbert sing the &quot;Fiacre,&quot; young Chamblard
threw up his arms and exclaimed: &quot;You never
heard the 'Fiacre,' and you had three months'
leave! What did you do in Paris? <i>I</i> know the
'Fiacre' by heart.&quot;</p>

<p>Upon which Raoul began to hum again, and
while humming in a voice which became more and
more slow, and more and more feeble, he settled
back into his arm-chair, and soon fell into a peaceful
slumber, like the big baby that he was.</p>

<p>All at once he was waked up with a start by the
stepping of the train, and by the voice of the conductor,
who cried, &quot;Ouah! Ouah! Ouah!&quot; The
cry is the same for all stations. This time it was
meant for Laroche. And now for the telegram.
Young Chamblard ran to the telegraph-office.
The immovable operator counted the sixty-seven
words of that queer despatch. &quot;All aboard, all
aboard!&quot;</p>

<p>Young Chamblard had scarcely time to jump on
the step of his car.</p>

<p>&quot;Ouf! that's done,&quot; he said to the cavalryman.
&quot;Suppose we lunch.&quot;</p>

<p>So they both started on their way to the dining-car.
It was quite a journey, for two parlor-cars
separated them from the restaurant-car, and those
two cars were crowded. It was the season for the
great pilgrimage of a few Parisians and a good
many English towards Nice, Cannes, and Monte
Carlo. The express was running very fast, and was
pitching violently. One needed sea-legs. Then a
furious wind beat against the train, and wrapped it
in clouds of dust, making the crossing of the platforms
particularly disagreeable.</p>

<p>They advanced, walking with difficulty through
the first car, over the first crossing, and encountering
the first squall, then through the second car; but
Chamblard, who went ahead, had difficulty in opening
the door to the second platform. It resisted
on account of the force of the wind; finally it yielded,
and Raoul received at the same time in his
eyes a cloud of dust, and in his arms a young
blonde, who exclaimed, &quot;Oh, excuse me!&quot; while
he, too, exclaimed, &quot;Oh, excuse me!&quot; and at the
same time he received the cavalryman on his back,
who, also blinded by the dust, was saying, &quot;Go on,
Raoul, go on.&quot;</p>

<p>The two doors of the cars had shut, and they
were all three crowded in the little passage in the
wind&mdash;young Raoul, young Maurice, and the young
blonde.</p>

<p>The &quot;Oh, excuse me&quot; was immediately followed
by a &quot;M. Maurice!&quot; which was replied to by a
&quot;Mlle. Martha!&quot; The little blonde knew the cavalryman,
and perceiving that she was almost in the
arms of a stranger, Mlle. Martha disengaged herself,
and backed cleverly towards the platform of
the car, saying to Maurice, &quot;You're on the train,
and you're going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To Algeria.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We to Marseilles. I am getting a shawl for
mamma, who is cold. Mamma will be delighted to
see you. You will find her in the dining-car. I'll
see you later.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I will accompany you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you like.&quot;</p>

<p>She walked on, but not without first having
slightly bowed to young Chamblard, who had remained
there astounded, contemplating Mlle. Martha
with eyes filled with admiration.</p>

<p>She had time before going to notice that he was
a good-looking young fellow, that he wore a neat
little suit, and that he looked at her with staring
eyes; but in those staring eyes a thought could
be clearly read that could not displease her: &quot;Oh,
how pretty you are!&quot;</p>

<p>Raoul was, in fact, saying to himself: &quot;My type,
exactly my type! And what style&mdash;what style in
the simplicity of that costume! And the little
toque, a little on one side over the ear&mdash;it's a masterpiece!
How well she knows how to dress! What
an effect she would make in an audience! And
that little English accent!&quot;</p>

<p>For she had a little English accent; she had even
taken a good deal of trouble for several years to
acquire that little accent. She used to say to her
governess, Miss Butler:</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, of course I want to know English, but I
wish especially to speak French with an English
accent.&quot; She had worked for nothing else. She
had been, fortunately, rewarded for her perseverance;
her little Anglo-Parisian gibberish was at
times quite original.</p>

<p>While Maurice was retracing his steps with Mlle.
Martha, Raoul placed himself at a table in the
dining-car. He soon saw them come back with
mamma's shawl. Maurice lingered for a few minutes
at the table where the mother and the young
brother of the little blonde were lunching. Then
he came back to Raoul, who said as soon as he
approached:</p>

<p>&quot;Who is she&mdash;quick, tell me, who is she? Whenever
one pleases I will marry her&mdash;now, on getting
down from the train. In my arms! I held her in
my arms! Such a waist! A dream! There are,
as you must know, slim waists and slim waists.
There are waists which are slim, hard, harsh, stiff,
bony, or mechanically made by odious artifices in
the corsets. I have thoroughly studied the corset
question. It's so important! And then there's the
true slim waist, which is easy, natural, supple. Supple
isn't sufficient for what just slid through my
hands a short time ago. Slippery&mdash;yes, that's the
word. Slippery just expresses my thought&mdash;a slippery
waist!&quot;</p>

<p>Raoul was quite charmed with what he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he continued, &quot;slippery; and that little
pug-nose! and her little eyes have quite a&mdash;a Chinese
air! But who is she, who is she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The daughter of one of my mother's friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is she rich?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very rich.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's on account of papa that I asked you
that, because I would marry her without a dowry.
It's the first time I've ever said such a
thing on meeting a young girl. And now the
name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mlle. Martha Derame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Derame, did you say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't the father a wealthy merchant who has
business in Japan and China?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my dear fellow&mdash;no; one only sees such
things in the comic plays of the minor theatres, at
Cluny or Dejazet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter with you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter with me? She's papa's Number
Three&mdash;yes, Number Three. The father of that
little marvel is one of papa's piquet players at the
club. And I wouldn't see Number Three, and she
falls into my arms on the platform between Paris
and Lyons. You will present me after lunch, and I
shall speak to the mother and tell her all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How, all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, all; that her daughter is papa's Number
Three, and that I didn't want Number One or Two,
but that I should like Number Three. Ah, dear boy,
how pretty she is&mdash;especially her nose, so charmingly
turned up. She has just looked at me, and in a
certain way; I am sure I don't displease her. Did
you mention me, did you tell my name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You were wrong. At any rate, right after
lunch&mdash;Do you know what I think? That this
affair will go through on wheels. I shall first telegraph
papa, and then to-morrow&mdash;Oh, heavens!
I hope there's a telephone between Paris and Marseilles&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He interrupted himself and called:</p>

<p>&quot;Porter! Porter!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is there a telephone between Paris and Marseilles?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! That's all Thanks. The telephone,
Maurice, there's the telephone! Papa can speak
for me to-morrow by telephone. It will be charming!
Marriage by express. Express, electric, telephonic,
and romantic marriage, all at the same
time. You understand that between a little phiz
like that and a voyage around the world I don't
hesitate. But why haven't you thought of marrying her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, too wealthy&mdash;too wealthy a match for me;
and then she is not the kind of little person to go
and bury in a garrison town in Algeria. She is a
Parisian, a true Parisian, who wants to amuse herself,
and who will amuse herself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just what I want, absolutely just what I want.
I too wish to amuse myself. She will amuse herself,
I shall amuse myself, we will amuse ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>Young Raoul was in a frenzy, and as soon as he
had finished his luncheon he scrawled a new despatch
on the restaurant table to his father, and,
while writing, talked very excitedly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll send my despatch from Dijon, and I'll address
it to the club; papa will be there about five
o'clock, and also the father of this little marvel.
They can immediately discuss the affair. Shall I
ask for an answer at Lyons? The time-table, pass
me the time-table. Lyons, 5.25. No, that would
be too short. Answer at Marseilles. They stop
at Marseilles? Yes? For twenty-four hours? All
right, so do I. At what hotel? H&ocirc;tel de Noailles?
All right, so do I. So answer H&ocirc;tel de Noailles.
My despatch is very good. You will see. As good
as the other&mdash;better, even. I've the knack of telegrams
to-day. Yes, it's very good.&quot;</p>

<p>He wrote and wrote; he was inspired, he was animated;
he made a few more mistakes than usual
in spelling, that was all&mdash;it was emotion. He reread
his despatch with complaisance, he made Maurice
read it, who could not help thinking the incident
funny. Raoul counted the words of his despatch&mdash;there
were about a hundred and fifty&mdash;and calling
the waiter of the dining-car, he said, &quot;Send this
telegram off for me at Dijon. Here are ten francs;
there will be two or three over for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Then turning at once to Maurice he asked, &quot;Is
that enough?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why certainly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, for such a marriage&mdash;ah, my dear fellow,
you sail to-morrow at what time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At two o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, we have plenty of time, then; all will be settled
by two o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, settled; you're crazy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all; it's already very far advanced, since
it's papa's Number Three. I only ask one thing of
you: present me to the mother shortly. After that
let me alone. I'll manage everything; only, at any
cost, we must leave our car and find two arm-chairs
in the same car, and near my mother-in-law.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your mother-in-law!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what I said; my mother-in-law. Once
the two arm-chairs are procured, I am master of the
situation. You don't know me. I already know
what I shall say to the mother, what I shall say to
my young brother-in-law (he is very nice), and what
I shall say to my future bride. I shall have made
a conquest of all of them before we reach Lyons.
Lyons? No; that's going a little fast&mdash;say Valence
or Mont&eacute;limar. Pass me the time-table again. Let
us settle everything, and leave nothing to chance.
Oh, look at her! She has nibbled nuts for the last
fifteen minutes, and how she cracks them&mdash;crack!
one little bite&mdash;and what pretty little teeth! She
is very pretty even while eating&mdash;an important
thing. It's very rare to find women who remain
pretty while eating and sleeping, very rare. Little
Adelaide, the red-headed one, you remember, ate
stupidly. And this one over there eats brightly;
she eats&mdash;crack! another nut&mdash;and she looks at me
on the sly. I can see that she looks at me. All
goes well, all goes well!&quot;</p>

<p>In truth, all did go well. At Montbard, 12.32,
Raoul was presented to Mme. Derame, who, on
hearing the name of Chamblard, had a little shiver&mdash;the
shiver of a mother who has a young daughter
to marry, and who says to herself, &quot;Oh, what a
splendid match!&quot; Her husband had often spoken
to her of young Chamblard.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; he used to say to her, &quot;what a marriage
for Martha! We speak of it sometimes before and
after our piquet, Chamblard and I; but the young
man is restive&mdash;doesn't yet wish to settle down.
It would be such a good thing&mdash;he is richer than
we. Chamblard is once, twice, three times richer!
And Martha isn't easy to marry; she has already
refused five or six desirable matches on all sorts
of pretexts. They didn't please her: they were too
old, they had no style, they didn't live in fashionable
neighborhoods, she didn't wish to go into
sugar, or cotton, or wine&mdash;or anything, in short.
She would accept none other than a young husband,
and not too serious. She must have a very
rich man who did nothing and loved pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p>How well young Chamblard answered to that
description! When there was question of doing
nothing, Raoul showed real talent. As soon as one
talked horses, dogs, carriages, hats, dresses, jewelry,
races, fencing, skating, cooking, etc., he showed
signs of the rarest and highest competence.</p>

<p>So, as there was general conversation, Raoul
was very brilliant. In the neighborhood of Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne
(3.10), while relating how he, Chamblard,
had invented a marvellous little coup&eacute;, he
did not say that: that coup&eacute; had been offered by
him to Mlle. Juliette Lorphelin, of the ballet corps
at the Folies-Berg&egrave;re. This coup&eacute; was a marvel;
besides, it was very well known; it was called the
Chamblard coup&eacute;.</p>

<p>&quot;Small,&quot; he said, &quot;very small. A coup&eacute; ought
always to be small.&quot; But what a lot of things in
such a small space: a drawer for toilet necessaries,
a secret box for money and jewelry, a clock, a thermometer,
a barometer, a writing-shelf&mdash;and that
was not all!</p>

<p>He became animated, and grew excited in speaking
of his invention. Martha listened to him eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;When you pull up the four wooden shutters
you naturally find yourself in the dark; but the four
shutters are mirrors, and as soon as one has placed
a finger on a little button hidden under the right-hand
cushion, six little crystal balls, ingeniously
scattered in the tufting of the blue satin of the
coup&eacute;, become electric lights. The coup&eacute; is turned
into a little lighted boudoir; and not only for five
minutes&mdash;no, but for an hour, two hours, if one
wishes it; there is a storage-battery under the seat.
When I submitted this idea to my carriage-maker
he was smitten with envy and admiration.&quot;</p>

<p>Martha, too, was smitten.</p>

<p>&quot;What a charming man!&quot; she said to herself.
&quot;Oh, to have such a coup&eacute;! But pearl-gray&mdash;I
should want it pearl-gray.&quot;</p>

<p>Then they discussed jewelry, dresses, hats, stuffs.
And Raoul proved on all those questions, if possible,
more remarkable than ever. He had paid so
many bills to great dress-makers, great milliners,
and great jewellers! He had been present at so
many conferences on the cut of such a dress or the
arrangement of such a costume, at so many scenes
of trying on and draping! And as he drew easily,
he willingly threw his ideas on paper, as he said,
neatly. He had even designed the costumes of
a little piece&mdash;played in I do not know what little
theatre&mdash;which was revolutionary, anarchistic, symbolistic,
decadent, end of the century, end of the
world.</p>

<p>He took his little note-book and began to outline
with a light hand, in spite of the movement of
the train, several of his creations. He had tact, and
thought of everything. &quot;It was,&quot; he said, &quot;for
charades played in society at my friend's, the baron
so and so.&quot; He invented the baron, and gave him
a resonant name.</p>

<p>Martha was delighted. Never had a man, since
she had been allowed to chat a little with young
men, seemed to her to have such an original and
interesting conversation.</p>

<p>&quot;Lately,&quot; said Raoul, &quot;one of my cousins&mdash;she
often applies to me&mdash;consulted me about a dress
for a ball at Nice, during the carnival. This is
what I advised her. See, I draw at the same time&mdash;look.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, how she did look!</p>

<p>&quot;I am going to try to make myself well understood.
A foundation of smooth white satin, clinging,
very clinging&mdash;blue, I adore blue.&quot;</p>

<p>That pained her; she disliked blue.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, very clinging; my cousin has a delightful
figure, and can stand it.&quot;</p>

<p>He took Martha's figure in with a hasty glance,
and the glance seemed to say, &quot;You could, too.&quot;
She understood and blushed, charmed with that
delicate flattery. Raoul continued:</p>

<p>&quot;Pale, very pale blue satin. Then on my foundation
I threw an over-dress of pompadour lace of
very soft tones: greens, pinks, mauves, cream, and
azure. Very large sleeves with a double puff of blue
velvet, wristlets of Venetian point. Am I clear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, very clear, very clear.&quot;</p>

<p>And in an excited voice she repeated:</p>

<p>&quot;A double puff of blue velvet, with wristlets of
Venetian point.&quot;</p>

<p>All of a sudden the brakes scraped, and the train
came sharply to a stop. One heard the cry of
&quot;M&acirc;con! M&acirc;con!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;M&acirc;con already!&quot; said Martha.</p>

<p>That &quot;<i>already</i>&quot; rang delightfully in Raoul's ears.
There was much in that <i>already</i>. Raoul profited
by the five minutes' stop to complete and fix his
little sketch, which was slightly jolted; and he did
not notice that his young brother-in-law had been
sent out with a despatch to the telegraph-office.
The despatch had been secretly written by Mme.
Derame, and had, too, been directed to the Old
Club.</p>

<p>The train started&mdash;4.11. Raoul had not thought
to get down to see if under the railing there was
not a despatch addressed to him. There was one,
which was to remain eternally at M&acirc;con. The telegram
contained these words: &quot;Return; no longer
question of Antwerp marriage.&quot;</p>

<p>The train ran on and on, and now there was
question of another dress&mdash;a silk dress, light pink,
with a large jabot of lace down the front. Raoul
literally dazzled Martha by his inexhaustible fertility
of wise expressions and technical terms.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>While the express passed the Roman&egrave;che station
(4.32) father Chamblard came into the Old Club,
went into the card-room, and met father Derame.
Piquet? With pleasure. So there they sat, face
to face. There were there eight or ten card-tables&mdash;piquet,
bezique, whist, etc. The works were in full
blast. First game, and papa Derame is rubiconed;
the second game was going to begin when a footman
arrives with a despatch for M. Chamblard.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you excuse me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

<p>He reads, he becomes red; he rereads, and he
gets scarlet.</p>

<p>It was Raoul's brilliant telegram from Dijon:</p>

<p>&quot;Dear father, I shall not go. Most extraordinary
meeting. Your Number Three&mdash;yes, your
Number Three&mdash;in the train with her mother, and
I wouldn't see her. Ah! if I had known. Strike
while the iron's hot; I'm striking it, strike it too.
M. D. must be at the club, speak to him at once;
tell him that I left to avoid marrying an ugly woman;
that I only wish to make a love-match; that I
am head-over-heels in love with his daughter. We
shall all be to-night at Marseilles, H&ocirc;tel de Noailles.
Get M. D. to back me up by telegraph to
Mme. D. I will talk with you to-morrow over the
telephone. I am writing my telegram in the dining-car.
At this moment she is nibbling nuts&mdash;charming,
she is charming! She fell into my arms on the
platform. Till to-morrow at the telephone, nine
o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p>M. Chamblard's agitation did not escape M.
Derame.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it a serious matter?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We can stop if you wish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; but first of all, did Mme. and Mlle. Derame
leave here this morning on the express for
Marseilles?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, at 9.55. Why do you ask that? Has
there been any accident?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no accident; it can't be called that; on
the contrary. Come, come into the little parlor.&quot;</p>

<p>He told him everything, showed him the despatch,
gave him certain necessary explanations
about the words, such as Number Three. And there
they were, choking, delighted&mdash;both the father of
the young man and the father of the young girl.
What luck, what a providential meeting!</p>

<p>&quot;But you told me that your son didn't wish to
marry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He didn't wish to, but he has seen your daughter,
and now he wishes to. Come, hurry up and
send a telegram to Marseilles to Mme. Derame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But she will be thunderstruck when I present
to her a son-in-law by telegraph.&quot;</p>

<p>Return of the footman. It was a despatch for
M. Derame. He opens it.</p>

<p>&quot;It's from my wife, from M&acirc;con, 2.15.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good,&quot; says M. Chamblard; &quot;all goes well, very
well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very disturbed. Met in the train the son of
M. C., of Rue Rougemont, your club friend. He
was presented by Maurice. You often spoke to
me of a possible alliance there. Evidently he thinks
her charming. Just at present he is talking to her,
and looks at her, looks at her. What shall I do?
Shall I put a stop to it or allow it to continue?
Large fortune, isn't there?&quot;</p>

<p>M. Derame in his turn showed his despatch to
M. Chamblard. They continued to talk, in high
good-humor and in excellent accord, and went on
with their game of piquet only after having sent the
following two telegrams to the H&ocirc;tel de Noailles:</p>

<p>First despatch to Mme. Derame: &quot;If it pleases
you, if it pleases her, yes. Enormous fortune.&quot;</p>

<p>Second despatch to Raoul: &quot;Have spoken to
D. He is telegraphing to Mme. D. He approves,
so do I.&quot;</p>

<p>A footman carried the two despatches at the
same time to the telegraph-office in the Place de la
Bourse, and during the time that, running over
the wires along the railroad, they passed the express
towards half-past six in the neighborhood of
Saint-Rambert, the Derames, Raoul, and Maurice,
in the best possible spirits and in most perfect
harmony, dined at the same table, and Martha
looked at Raoul, and Raoul looked at Martha, and
Mme. Derame said to herself: &quot;Martha's falling in
love; I know her, she is falling in love. She fell in
love just so last year at a ball with a little youth
who was very dandified, but without fortune. This
time, luckily, yes&mdash;Edward told me so&mdash;there is
plenty of money; so, naturally, if Martha is willing
we are.&quot;</p>

<p>The train ran on, and on, and on; and Raoul
talked, and talked, and talked. He even let slip
practical thoughts, raised himself up to general
ideas, and developed with force the theory that
the first duty of a woman was to be, in all things,
refined elegance. He explained, with endless detail,
what the life of an absolutely correct fashionable
woman was, what it was to be an absolutely
fashionable woman. He triumphantly took <i>his
fashionable woman</i> from Paris to Trouville, from
Trouville to Lake Como, from Lake Como to Monte-Carlo.
He drew the trunks of the fashionable
woman, marvellous trunks, which were heaped up
in the vestibules of first-class hotels. Besides, he
had also invented a trunk.</p>

<p>Then, very tactfully, he put Martha through a
little examination, which had nothing in common
with the examinations of the Sorbonne or the H&ocirc;tel
de Ville.</p>

<p>&quot;Did she skate?&quot; That's what he wanted to
know first! He was himself a very distinguished
skater. He needed a sport-loving wife. He had
but just pronounced the word skating when suddenly
the young brother (how precious little brothers
sometimes are) exclaimed: &quot;Ah, it's sister who
skates well! She makes figures-of-eight. And who
swims well, too&mdash;like a fish!&quot;</p>

<p>She skated, she swam, she was sport-loving.
Raoul said to the young girl, with deep enthusiasm:
&quot;I congratulate you. A woman who can't swim
isn't a woman.&quot;</p>

<p>And he added, with increasing energy:</p>

<p>&quot;A woman who can't skate isn't a woman.&quot;</p>

<p>When he had a strong thought, he willingly used
it again in a brief but striking form.</p>

<p>Martha's face beamed with joy. She was really
a woman. Never had a sweeter word been said to
her.</p>

<p>Night had come; it was necessary, therefore, to
tear one's self away from that exquisite conversation,
and return to the parlor-car. Young Derame
was going to sleep; so they began to prepare for
the trip through the train.</p>

<p>Here is the platform, the platform of the morning,
the platform of the first meeting. She walks
ahead of him, and in a whisper he says to her, &quot;It's
here that this morning&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She turns round, and smiling repeats, &quot;Yes, it's
here that this morning&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Always with that little English accent which
never leaves her, even when she is most agitated.</p>

<p><i>It is here that this morning</i>&mdash;That was all, and
it said all. A delightful evening. No more rain,
no more dust. Already there was the soft, balmy
air of the South. The moon lit that idyl at full
speed. Spring-time everywhere, in the sky and in
the hearts.</p>

<p>&quot;She loves me,&quot; he said to himself.</p>

<p>&quot;He adores me,&quot; she said to herself.</p>

<p>How right they were to give themselves up thus,
without a struggle, without resistance, to the inclination
which carried them, quite naturally, towards
each other. There had been between them,
from the first word, so perfect, so complete a community
of tastes, ideas, and sentiments. They were
so well made, this little puppet and this little doll,
to roll off, both together, gloriously in the &quot;Chamblard
coup&eacute;,&quot; so well matched to walk in the world,
accomplishing mechanically, automatically, at the
right hour, in the prescribed costume, everywhere
where it was correct to take pleasure, all the functions
of fashionable life, and all the rituals of worldly
worship.</p>

<p>They arrive in the parlor-car. The shades are
drawn over the lamps; travellers are stiff, drowsy,
and asleep in the big red arm-chairs.</p>

<p>&quot;Change places,&quot; Raoul whispers to Maurice;
&quot;sit beside her. I am going to sit by the mother;
I must speak to her.&quot;</p>

<p>Maurice lent himself to this man&oelig;uvre with perfect
docility, Martha did not understand it. Why
did he abandon her? Why was he talking to her
mother, and so low, so low that she couldn't hear?
What was he saying? What was he saying?</p>

<p>This is what he said between Mont&eacute;limar, 8.35,
and Pierrelatte, 8.55:</p>

<p>&quot;Listen to me, madam, listen to me. I am an
honest man; I wish, I ought, to let you know the
situation, the entire situation. Let us first settle
an important point. My father knows M. Derame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Another more important point. Let us mention
the essential things first. My father is very
rich.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, I know that too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good, then, very good. I continue. I left Paris
this morning, and I have here in my pocket a ticket
for cabin No. 27 on the <i>Traonaddy</i>, which leaves
to-morrow at four o'clock from the Bay of Joliette
for Suez, Aden, Colombo, and Singapore, and I
shall go on board to-morrow at four o'clock if you
don't let me hope to become your son-in-law.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't move, madam, don't move. Mlle. Martha
is pretending to sleep, but she isn't sleeping;
she is watching us, and I haven't said all yet. I
am but just beginning. You are going to answer
me&mdash;oh, I know it&mdash;that you don't know me, that
Mlle. Martha doesn't know me. Allow me to tell
you that Mlle. Martha and myself know each other
better than three-fourths of engaged couples on the
day of their marriage. You know how it is usually
done. A rapid glance from afar in a theatre&mdash;one
brings good lorgnettes, one examines. 'How do
you like him?' 'Fairly, fairly.' Then, several days
later, at a ball, in the midst of the figures of
the quadrille, several gasping, breathless phrases
are exchanged. Then a meeting in a picture-gallery.
There, there is more intimacy, because it
takes place in a small room. It happened to me
with a young provincial. I had pegged away that
morning at the Joanne guide, so as to be able to
find something to say about the Raphaels and the
Murillos. And at the end of several interviews of
that sort it is over, one has made acquaintance,
one suits the other, and the marriage is decided.
Mlle. Martha and I are already old comrades. In
the first place, to begin with, this morning at half-past
eleven she fell into my arms.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My daughter in your arms!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't jump, madam; Mlle. Martha will see you
jump.&quot;</p>

<p>Martha had, in fact, closely followed the scene
with half-shut eyes, and said to herself, &quot;Good gracious!
what is he telling mamma? She is obliged
to hold on to the arms of her seat to keep herself
from jumping up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, madam, in my arms; by the greatest, by
the most fortunate of accidents, we stumbled over
each other on one of the platforms of the train.
And since I have seen her, not in the false light
of a theatre or a gallery, but in the full glare of sunlight.
I have seen her at lunch, munching nuts with
the prettiest teeth there are in the world; I have
seen her, just now, in the moonlight; and I know
that she skates, and I know that she swims, and I
know she would like to have a pearl-gray coup&eacute;, and
she ought to have it. And now I admire her in the
semi-obscurity. Ravishing! isn't she ravishing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir, never has a mother found herself&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In such a situation? I acknowledge it, madam,
and for that very reason you must get out of the
situation quickly; it's evident that it can't be prolonged.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's true&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here is what I propose to you. You go to the
H&ocirc;tel de Noailles; I, too, naturally. You have all
the morning to-morrow to talk to Mlle. Martha, and
the telephone to talk through to M. Derame. You
know who I am. You have seen me, too, in the
daylight. I have talked&mdash;talked a great deal. You
could, you and Mlle. Martha, find out what I am,
what I think. Well, to-morrow&mdash;what time do you
expect to breakfast to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I don't know. I assure you that I am
choking, upset, overcome.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us settle on an hour all the same; eleven
o'clock&mdash;will you, at eleven?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you wish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, to-morrow at eleven o'clock I shall be in
the dining-room of the hotel. If you say 'Go' I
shall go; if you say 'Stay' I shall stay. Don't
answer me; take time to reflect; it's worth while.
Till to-morrow, madam, till to-morrow at eleven.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the morning very interesting communications
passed between Paris and Marseilles.</p>

<p>When Mme. Derame entered the dining-room of
the hotel at eleven o'clock, Raoul went straight to
her, and the cavalryman, always adroit in his man&oelig;uvres,
had taken possession of Mlle. Martha. A
short dialogue ensued between Raoul and Mme.
Derame, who was much agitated.</p>

<p>&quot;They tell me there are boats every fortnight
between Indo-China and Marseilles&mdash;you could put
off your departure&mdash;merely taking another boat&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, thanks, madam, thanks!&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At two o'clock the Derames and young Chamblard
accompanied Maurice to the boat for Africa.
On the deck of the steamer Raoul said to his
friend:</p>

<p>&quot;It's understood that you are to be best man.
On arriving, ask your colonel for leave at once. It
will take place, I think, in six weeks.&quot;</p>

<p>Raoul was mistaken. It was decidedly an express
marriage; five weeks were sufficient.</p>

<p>When they were mounting the steps of the
Madeleine, Raoul said to Martha:</p>

<p>&quot;Twelve o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you thinking of?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, you too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Twelve, the hour of the platform, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that's it.&quot;</p>

<p>They began to laugh, but quickly became serious,
and made an irreproachable entry into church.</p>

<p>They were looked at eagerly, and on all sides
the following remarks were exchanged:</p>

<p>&quot;You know it's a love-match.&quot; &quot;Yes, it appears
it was a meeting on the train.&quot; &quot;A lightning-stroke!&quot;
&quot;What a charming affair!&quot; &quot;And so
rare!&quot; &quot;Oh yes, so rare! A love-match! A true
love-match!&quot;</p>

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
